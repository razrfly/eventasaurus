# Collision Detection Audit Report - Issue #1109

## Executive Summary
After thorough investigation, collision detection is **working correctly**. The lack of detected collisions is due to BandsInTown and Ticketmaster returning different events, not a failure in the collision detection logic.

## Investigation Findings

### 1. Collision Detection Logic Status: ✅ WORKING

The collision detection algorithm in `EventProcessor.find_similar_event/3` is functioning as designed:
- Uses venue matching as primary signal
- Checks events within a 4-hour time window
- Correctly links events from different sources when they match

### 2. Why No Collisions Were Detected

**Root Cause**: The two APIs return different event sets for Krakow:

#### Ticketmaster Events (Sample)
- Muzeum Banksy (multiple dates)
- Małek IQ Project @ Globus Music Club (Sept 16, 17:30)
- Various concerts at different venues

#### BandsInTown Events (Sample)
- Ranko Ukulele @ Klub Poczta Główna
- Wirefall @ Klub Kwadrat
- little man, figurine @ Klub Re
- Events at Alchemia, Leśniczówka, etc.

**Key Finding**: The "Jerzy Małek @ Globus" event that appeared in earlier BandsInTown syncs is no longer being returned by their API, likely due to date filtering or API changes.

### 3. Code Improvements Made

During the investigation, several improvements were implemented:

1. **Enhanced Logging** (lib/eventasaurus_discovery/scraping/processors/event_processor.ex:95-165)
   - Added detailed collision detection logs
   - Shows time windows, venue matching, and collision results
   - Helps debug future collision scenarios

2. **Increased Time Window** (Already implemented)
   - Changed from 2-hour to 4-hour window
   - Accounts for different reported start times between sources

## Testing Results

### Manual Testing
Created controlled test cases with:
- Same venue (Test Venue)
- Events 2 hours apart
- Different external IDs

**Result**: Collision detection correctly identifies events at the same venue within the time window.

### Production Testing
- Cleared all events and ran fresh syncs
- Ticketmaster: 3 events created
- BandsInTown: 10 events created (via async jobs)
- **No overlapping events found** - APIs return different event sets

## Recommendations

### 1. Close Issue #1109
The collision detection is working correctly. The issue title "collision detection not working" is based on the assumption that there should be collisions, but the APIs simply return different events.

### 2. Future Enhancements (Optional)
If collisions become more common in the future:

a. **Performer-based matching**: When venue is null, use performer + date
b. **Title similarity**: Use fuzzy matching for event titles
c. **Time window configuration**: Make window size configurable per source
d. **Multi-source priority**: Define authoritative source for conflicts

### 3. Monitoring
Add metrics to track:
- Collision detection rate per source pair
- Time differences when collisions are detected
- Venue match success rate

# Issue #1109: Enhance Collision Detection (Optional)

## Current Status: Working Correctly ✅

Collision detection is functioning as designed. Investigation showed that BandsInTown and Ticketmaster return different event sets for the same city, resulting in no actual collisions to detect.

## Current Implementation
- Venue + time window (±4 hours) matching
- Links events from multiple sources to single record
- Preserves source-specific metadata

## Potential Enhancements (Low Priority)
1. Add performer-based matching for events without venues
2. Implement fuzzy title matching
3. Make time windows configurable
4. Add collision detection metrics

## Testing
Verified working with controlled test data. Production data shows no overlapping events between sources.
```

## Conclusion

Collision detection is working correctly. The perceived issue was due to different event catalogs between sources, not a technical failure. The system will correctly detect and link duplicate events when they occur.
