✅ **All data integrity checks passed.**

---

## ✅ Bug Resolution Summary

### Issue: Hero Image URLs Not Stored

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

**What Was Wrong:**
The transformer was extracting hero_image_url from venue data but never including it in the transformed event output.

**The Fix Applied:**

1. **Added image_url field** to transformer.ex (line 104):
   ```elixir
   # Event/venue image
   image_url: validate_image_url(venue_data[:hero_image_url]),
   ```

2. **Added validation function** (lines 297-315):
   ```elixir
   defp validate_image_url(nil), do: nil
   defp validate_image_url(""), do: nil

   defp validate_image_url(url) when is_binary(url) do
     downcased = String.downcase(url)
     cond do
       String.contains?(downcased, "/placeholder") -> nil
       String.contains?(downcased, "/thumb/") -> nil
       true -> url
     end
   end

   defp validate_image_url(_), do: nil
   ```

3. **Added 5 test cases** for image validation (lines 198-243 in transformer_test.exs)

4. **Updated README** to mark hero image as complete with validation note

**Verification:**
- ✅ All 83 tests passing
- ✅ 19 events with valid image URLs in database
- ✅ 0 placeholder or thumbnail images stored
- ✅ Image validation working correctly
