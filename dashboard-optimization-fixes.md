# Dashboard Optimization - Bug Fixes

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Removed Unrelated Test File
- **Issue**: The test file `test/eventasaurus_web/live/event_live/group_id_preselection_test.exs` was accidentally included
- **Fix**: Removed from git using `git rm`
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

### 2. Added Error Handling for Failed Async Tasks
- **Issue**: Dashboard could get stuck in loading state if async tasks crashed
- **Fix**: Added `handle_info({:DOWN, ref, :process, _pid, reason}, socket)` handler
- **Features**:
  - Properly removes crashed tasks from `loading_tasks`
  - Logs error messages for debugging
  - Falls back to synchronous loading if current tab's task crashes
  - Updates loading state correctly
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

### 3. Extracted Duplicate Async Task Creation Code
- **Issue**: Task creation logic was duplicated in `mount` and `refresh_events`
- **Fix**: Created `start_async_loading_tasks/1` helper function
- **Benefits**:
  - Follows DRY principle
  - Easier maintenance
  - Consistent task creation
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

## Code Quality Improvements

1. **Better Error Resilience**: Dashboard won't get stuck if a query fails
2. **Cleaner Code**: Removed ~40 lines of duplicate code
3. **Proper Logging**: Added error logging for debugging failed tasks
4. **Graceful Fallback**: Falls back to sync loading when async fails

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with a failing database query to ensure error handling works
2. Verify dashboard doesn't get stuck in loading state
3. Check server logs for proper error messages when tasks fail
4. Confirm refresh button still works correctly
