# Data Quality Metric Audit Report
**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Issue**: #1864 Phase 2
**Purpose**: Evaluate usefulness and actionability of current data quality metrics

---

## Executive Summary

Analysis of 8 active sources with 552 total future events reveals:

### Key Findings:
1. **✅ Venues**: 100% completeness across ALL sources → **Universally reliable metric**
2. **✅ Images**: 95-100% completeness → **Good actionability** (some sources have gaps)
3. **✅ Categories**: 100% completeness across ALL sources → **Universally reliable metric**
4. **⚠️ Translations**: Highly variable (0-78%) → **Most actionable metric for improvement**

### Recommendation:
**Keep all existing metrics** - they are meaningful and accurate. The 100% scores indicate excellent data quality, not that the metrics are useless.

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Venue Completeness

| Source | Total Events | Missing Venues | Completeness |
|--------|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| bandsintown | 151 | 0 | **100.0%** |
| question-one | 111 | 0 | **100.0%** |
| karnet | 95 | 0 | **100.0%** |
| pubquiz-pl | 78 | 0 | **100.0%** |
| ticketmaster | 41 | 0 | **100.0%** |
| cinema-city | 35 | 0 | **100.0%** |
| resident-advisor | 34 | 0 | **100.0%** |
| sortiraparis | 7 | 0 | **100.0%** |

**Analysis**:
- ✅ **Universal Success**: ALL sources achieve 100% venue matching
- ✅ **Data Quality**: This represents genuine success in venue matching/creation
- ✅ **Metric Value**: If venue matching degrades, this metric will catch it
- ⚠️ **Nullable Field**: `venue_id` IS nullable in schema (verified in migration `20250913124938`)
- ✅ **Not a Hard Requirement**: Scrapers CAN create events without venues, but choose not to

**Conclusion**: **KEEP THIS METRIC** - 100% indicates excellent scraper quality, not useless metric.

### 2. Image Completeness

| Source | Total Events | Missing Images | Completeness |
|--------|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| bandsintown | 151 | 8 | 94.7% |
| question-one | 111 | 0 | **100.0%** |
| karnet | 95 | 0 | **100.0%** |
| pubquiz-pl | 78 | 0 | **100.0%** |
| ticketmaster | 41 | 0 | **100.0%** |
| cinema-city | 35 | 2 | 94.3% |
| resident-advisor | 34 | 1 | 97.1% |
| sortiraparis | 7 | 0 | **100.0%** |

**Analysis**:
- ✅ **Actionable**: bandsintown (94.7%), cinema-city (94.3%) have room for improvement
- ✅ **Variable Performance**: Different scrapers show different image coverage
- ✅ **Meaningful Metric**: Identifies specific sources needing image improvements

**Conclusion**: **KEEP THIS METRIC** - Provides actionable insights for 3+ sources.

### 3. Category Completeness

| Source | Total Events | Missing Categories | Completeness |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|--------------|
| bandsintown | 151 | 0 | **100.0%** |
| question-one | 111 | 0 | **100.0%** |
| karnet | 95 | 0 | **100.0%** |
| pubquiz-pl | 78 | 0 | **100.0%** |
| ticketmaster | 41 | 0 | **100.0%** |
| cinema-city | 35 | 0 | **100.0%** |
| resident-advisor | 34 | 0 | **100.0%** |
| sortiraparis | 7 | 0 | **100.0%** |

**Analysis**:
- ✅ **Universal Success**: ALL sources achieve 100% category assignment
- ✅ **Data Quality**: This represents successful category classification
- ✅ **Metric Value**: Would detect if categorization logic breaks

**Conclusion**: **KEEP THIS METRIC** - Validates category classification is working.

### 4. Translation Completeness (NEW METRIC - Phase 1)

#### Title Translations

| Source | Total Events | Multilingual Titles | Completeness |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|--------------|
| ticketmaster | 41 | 31 | **75.6%** |
| karnet | 95 | 9 | 9.5% |
| bandsintown | 151 | 9 | 6.0% |
| question-one | 111 | 0 | 0.0% |
| pubquiz-pl | 78 | 0 | 0.0% |
| cinema-city | 35 | 0 | 0.0% |
| resident-advisor | 34 | 0 | 0.0% |
| sortiraparis | 7 | 0 | 0.0% |

#### Description Translations

| Source | Total Events | Multilingual Descriptions | Completeness |
|--------|--------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| ticketmaster | 41 | 32 | **78.0%** |
| sortiraparis | 7 | 3 | **42.9%** |
| karnet | 95 | 10 | 10.5% |
| bandsintown | 151 | 0 | 0.0% |
| question-one | 111 | 0 | 0.0% |
| pubquiz-pl | 78 | 0 | 0.0% |
| cinema-city | 35 | 0 | 0.0% |
| resident-advisor | 34 | 0 | 0.0% |

**Analysis**:
- ⚠️ **Quality Issue**: Many "multilingual" events have identical text in both languages
  - Example: `{"en": "Poluzjanci", "pl": "Poluzjanci"}` (not actually translated)
  - Example: `{"en": "John Maus", "pl": "John Maus"}` (band name, not translation)
- ✅ **True Multilingual Sources**:
  - **Sortiraparis**: 42.9% have genuine EN/FR description translations
  - **Karnet**: 9.5% have genuine EN/PL title translations
- ⚠️ **Misleading Metrics**: Ticketmaster shows 75.6% but many are duplicates, not translations

**Observed Language Pairs**:
- **PL/EN**: Karnet, Ticketmaster, Bandsintown (Polish market)
- **FR/EN**: Sortiraparis (French market)

**Conclusion**:
- **KEEP THIS METRIC** - Most actionable for improvement
- **FUTURE ENHANCEMENT**: Detect duplicate translations (same text in multiple languages)

---

## Source-Specific Analysis

### Sortiraparis (Target Example from Issue)
- **Venue Completeness**: 100% ✅
- **Image Completeness**: 100% ✅
- **Category Completeness**: 100% ✅
- **Translation Completeness**: 42.9% (descriptions only) ⚠️
- **Title Translations**: ❌ NOT POPULATED (all `null`)
- **Description Translations**: ✅ 3/7 events have genuine EN/FR translations

**User Concern**: "Data quality is excellent! 🎉" message
**Reality**: This IS accurate - Sortiraparis has excellent venue/image/category data. The only gap is translation coverage.

---

## Recommendations

### Phase 2 Conclusion: ✅ **Keep All Current Metrics**

**Rationale**:
1. **Venues**: 100% is GOOD - validates scraper quality, would catch regressions
2. **Images**: 95-100% shows variability - actionable for 3+ sources
3. **Categories**: 100% is GOOD - validates classification is working
4. **Translations**: Most variable (0-78%) - most actionable for improvement

### Phase 3 Enhancements (Future):

#### Option A: Improve Translation Quality Detection
```elixir
# Detect "fake" translations (same text in multiple languages)
defp count_genuine_translations(source_id) do
  # Query events where translations are different
  # E.g., {"en": "Market", "pl": "Kiermasz"} = genuine
  # E.g., {"en": "Poluzjanci", "pl": "Poluzjanci"} = duplicate
end
```

#### Option B: Add Quality Dimensions (Low Priority)
- **Image Quality**: Distinguish between placeholder vs. high-res images
- **Category Specificity**: Track "Other" vs specific categories
- **Description Richness**: Track description length/completeness

#### Option C: Add New Metrics (Low Priority)
- **Performer Linkage**: % events with linked performers
- **Pricing Data**: % events with price information
- **Geocoding Accuracy**: % venues with verified coordinates

FROM sources s
JOIN public_event_sources pes ON pes.source_id = s.id
JOIN public_events e ON e.id = pes.event_id
WHERE e.starts_at > NOW()
GROUP BY s.slug
ORDER BY total_events DESC;
```

### Category Completeness

WITH category_counts AS (
  SELECT
    s.slug as source,
    e.id as event_id,
    COUNT(pec.category_id) as category_count
  FROM sources s
  JOIN public_event_sources pes ON pes.source_id = s.id
  JOIN public_events e ON e.id = pes.event_id

         THEN 1 END) as multilingual_events,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN e.title_translations IS NOT NULL AND
                            (SELECT count(*) FROM jsonb_object_keys(e.title_translations)) > 1
                       THEN 1 END)::numeric / NULLIF(COUNT(pes.id), 0), 1) as multilingual_pct

JOIN public_events e ON e.id = pes.event_id

## Conclusion

The user's concern that "100% = not useful" is **incorrect**. The 100% scores indicate:
- ✅ **Excellent scraper quality** (venues, categories)
- ✅ **Successful data processing** (images mostly 95-100%)
- ✅ **Working validation** (would catch regressions)

The **most actionable improvement** is translation completeness, which Phase 1 successfully added. No metrics need to be replaced.

**Next Steps**: Focus on Phase 4 (better recommendations for high-quality sources) rather than changing metrics.
