# Debug Real-Time Updates

## Current Implementation Status
- ✅ Components have handle_info callbacks
- ✅ Components subscribe to PubSub topics
- ✅ Broadcasting functions exist
- ✅ Debug logging added

## How to Test Right Now

1. **Open two browser tabs** with the same poll URL
2. **Vote in one tab** 
3. **Watch the other tab** for:
   - Voter count changes in header
   - Progress bars updating
   - Vote percentages changing

## Check Server Logs
Look for these debug messages when voting:
- `DEBUG: Broadcasted poll stats update for poll X`
- `DEBUG: VotingInterfaceComponent received poll_stats_updated`

## If Still Not Working
The issue might be:
1. WebSocket connection problems
2. Subscription timing issues
3. Stats not being calculated correctly
4. Component not re-rendering properly

## Next Steps
- Test with actual voting
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify WebSocket connection in DevTools
