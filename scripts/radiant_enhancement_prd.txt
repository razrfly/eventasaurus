# Eventasaurus Radiant-Inspired Design Enhancement PRD

## Project Overview
Enhance Eventasaurus with sophisticated design elements inspired by the Radiant Tailwind CSS template while preserving Phoenix best practices and existing functionality. This is a visual enhancement project focused on improving the user interface without changing core functionality.

## Technical Stack
- Phoenix/Elixir framework (existing)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Phoenix LiveView components
- HEEx templates
- Existing authentication system (Supabase)
- Existing theme system integration

## Core Requirements

### 1. Background Gradient System
Create a sophisticated gradient background system similar to Radiant's approach:
- Implement positioned gradient blobs for ambient lighting effects
- Support multiple gradient themes (default dinosaur theme: green/yellow/pink)
- Create reusable Phoenix components for gradient application
- Ensure gradients work seamlessly with existing navbar transparency
- Maintain white background with gradient overlays (not full-screen gradients)

### 2. Enhanced Navbar Integration
Improve navbar to work elegantly over gradient backgrounds:
- Implement glassmorphism effects with backdrop blur
- Maintain transparency when over gradients
- Preserve existing authentication functionality
- Ensure proper contrast and readability
- Keep responsive behavior intact

### 3. Authentication Form Enhancement
Modernize login and registration forms with Radiant-inspired styling:
- Implement centered card layouts with rounded corners and shadows
- Add sophisticated input field styling with enhanced focus states
- Apply gradient backgrounds behind forms
- Maintain all existing form functionality and validation
- Preserve CSRF protection and security features

### 4. Page Layout Structure Updates
Update public page layouts to support the new gradient system:
- Apply gradient backgrounds to main public pages (home, about, what's new)
- Implement proper container structure with overflow handling
- Ensure responsive design across all device sizes
- Maintain existing theme system compatibility

### 5. Component Architecture
Create reusable components for the gradient system:
- `gradient/1` component for direct gradient application
- `gradient_background/1` component for ambient background effects
- Support for multiple theme variations
- Integration with existing Phoenix component patterns

## Specific Implementation Details

### Gradient Specifications
- Primary gradient: `bg-gradient-to-br from-yellow-100 via-pink-300 to-purple-500`
- Positioning: Absolute positioned blobs with blur effects
- Responsive: Different positioning for mobile vs desktop
- Opacity: 60% for ambient lighting effect

### Theme Variations
Support multiple gradient themes:
- Default (Dinosaur): Green, yellow, pink harmony
- Forest: Emerald and teal colors  
- Sunset: Orange, pink, and purple
- Ocean: Blues, cyans, and teals
- Cosmic: Purples, pinks, and indigo
- Minimal: Subtle grays for professional look

### Navbar Enhancements
- Background: `bg-white/80 backdrop-blur-md`
- Border: `border-white/20`
- Text colors: `gray-700` for better contrast
- Maintain existing navigation structure

### Form Styling
- Container: `max-w-md rounded-xl bg-white shadow-md ring-1 ring-black/5`
- Layout: `min-h-dvh flex items-center justify-center`
- Input styling: Enhanced focus states with outline styling
- Background: Gradient ambient lighting behind forms

## Pages to Update
1. Home page (/) - Apply default gradient theme
2. About page (/about) - Apply default gradient theme  
3. What's New page (/whats-new) - Apply default gradient theme
4. Components showcase page (/components) - Demonstrate all gradient themes
5. Authentication pages (/auth/login, /auth/register) - Enhanced form styling
6. Index page (/index) - Apply default gradient theme

## Technical Constraints
- Must preserve all existing Phoenix functionality
- Cannot break authentication system
- Must maintain theme system compatibility
- Should not impact page load performance
- Must work across all supported browsers
- Must maintain accessibility standards

## Success Criteria
1. Gradient backgrounds render correctly on all target pages
2. Navbar transparency works seamlessly over gradients
3. Authentication forms have modern, card-based layouts
4. All existing functionality remains intact
5. Responsive design works across device sizes
6. Performance remains acceptable
7. Accessibility standards are maintained

## Out of Scope
- Major functional changes to authentication
- Complete redesign of existing components beyond styling
- Changes to Phoenix routing or controllers
- Database schema modifications
- Addition of new JavaScript dependencies
- Modification of core business logic

## Implementation Phases
1. Create base gradient components and test in isolation
2. Implement background gradient system in root layout
3. Update navbar for gradient compatibility
4. Enhance authentication form styling
5. Apply gradients to all main public pages
6. Final testing and polish

This enhancement will give Eventasaurus a modern, sophisticated visual appearance while maintaining its robust Phoenix architecture and functionality.
