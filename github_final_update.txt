### The Real Culprit

**It's NOT a participant creation issue** - that works fine. 

**The Problem**: Mismatched expectations between two seed files:

1. **`DiversePollingEvents`** ‚úÖ Working correctly
   - Creates movie events with participants  
   - Creates date polls (binary voting)
   - Creates movie polls (**star rating**, not RCV)

2. **`poll_seed.exs`** ‚ùå Not creating RCV polls
   - Expects to find events with participants for RCV poll creation
   - Gets confused by coordination with DiversePollingEvents

### Timeline of the Break

**Recent CodeRabbit commit** `de25b90f` "fixed" `DiversePollingEvents` execution by adding:
```elixir
if Code.ensure_loaded?(DiversePollingEvents) and function_exported?(DiversePollingEvents, :run, 0) do
  DiversePollingEvents.run()
else
  Helpers.error("DiversePollingEvents module not properly loaded")
end
```

**Before this fix**: `DiversePollingEvents` was loaded but never executed, so only `poll_seed.exs` ran
**After this fix**: Both modules run, but they don't coordinate properly for RCV poll creation

### The Solution

The issue is **seed file coordination**, not core functionality. Both modules work individually but interfere with each other.

**Moving to 09-06-polling branch to implement the fix.**

### Key Insight
`DiversePollingEvents` creates **star rating polls** for movies, not RCV polls. The RCV functionality exists and works - it's just not being triggered during seeding due to the coordination issue between seed files.
