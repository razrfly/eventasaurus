# Test Report - Code Changes Verification

## Test Date: 2025-09-15

## Changes Tested
1. Performer slug-based lookup
2. BandsInTown source configuration deduplication
3. Safe map access in SourceStore
4. Rate limit division safety

## Test Results

### ✅ Ticketmaster Sync - PASSED

**Test**: Synced 3 events from Warsaw
```
Events created: 3
- All events have venues ✅
- All events have categories ✅
- All events have performers (2 each) ✅
```

**Sample Data**:
- Tamino, support: Sam De Nef @ Klub Stodoła (2 performers)
- Go-Jo - Milkshake Man Tour @ Klub Hydrozagadka (2 performers)
- Avi Kaplan: Move Our Souls Tour @ Klub Progresja (2 performers)

### ✅ BandsInTown Sync - PASSED

**Test**: Synced 5 events from Warsaw
```
Events created: 5
- All events have venues ✅
- All events have categories ✅
- All events have performers (1 each) ✅
```

**Sample Data**:
- Tamino @ Klub Stodoła (1 performer)
- Avi Kaplan @ Klub Progresja (1 performer)
- MONGIRD @ Pałacyk Ksawerego Konopackiego (1 performer)

### ✅ Performer Deduplication - PASSED

**Test**: Same performers from both sources
```
Result: Correctly deduplicated
- Tamino: Single record with slug "tamino"
- Avi Kaplan: Single record with slug "avi-kaplan"
```

The slug-based lookup change is working correctly.

### ⚠️ Collision Detection - NEEDS INVESTIGATION

**Issue Found**: Events that should collide are not being detected

**Examples**:
1. **Tamino Events**:
   - Ticketmaster: 2025-09-15 18:00:00 @ Klub Stodoła
   - BandsInTown: 2025-09-15 19:00:00 @ Klub Stodoła
   - Time difference: 1 hour (within 4-hour window)
   - **Expected**: Should be linked as same event
   - **Actual**: Created as separate events

2. **Avi Kaplan Events**:
   - Ticketmaster: 2025-09-16 16:00:00 @ Klub Progresja
   - BandsInTown: 2025-09-16 18:00:00 @ Klub Progresja
   - Time difference: 2 hours (within 4-hour window)
   - **Expected**: Should be linked as same event
   - **Actual**: Created as separate events

**Root Cause**: BandsInTown events are processed asynchronously via Oban jobs. When these jobs execute after Ticketmaster has already created events, the collision detection logic should find and link them, but it's not working as expected.

### ✅ Source Configuration - PASSED

The source configuration deduplication for BandsInTown is working correctly - using `source_config()` function.

### ✅ Safe Map Access - PASSED

SourceStore is using bracket notation safely - no runtime errors.

### ✅ Rate Limiting Safety - PASSED

Rate limit division is protected against division by zero.

## Summary

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Ticketmaster Sync | ✅ PASSED | All data populated correctly |
| BandsInTown Sync | ✅ PASSED | All data populated correctly |
| Performer Deduplication | ✅ PASSED | Slug-based lookup working |
| Venue Creation | ✅ PASSED | All venues created and linked |
| Category Assignment | ✅ PASSED | All events have categories |
| Source Config | ✅ PASSED | No duplication |
| Safe Map Access | ✅ PASSED | No runtime errors |
| Rate Limit Safety | ✅ PASSED | Protected from division by zero |
| **Collision Detection** | ⚠️ ISSUE | Not detecting obvious collisions |

## Recommendations

1. **Collision Detection Issue**: The collision detection logic appears to have a bug when BandsInTown processes events after Ticketmaster. The `find_similar_event` function should be catching these but isn't. This needs further investigation.

2. **All Other Features**: Working correctly after the code improvements.

## Conclusion

The code changes are working correctly for:
- Performer deduplication (slug-based lookup)
- Source configuration (no duplication)
- Safe map access
- Rate limit safety

However, collision detection between sources has a pre-existing issue that needs to be addressed separately.
