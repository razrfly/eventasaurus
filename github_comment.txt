## 🎯 Root Cause Found: Event Participants Issue

### Final Audit Results

**The Problem**: RCV polls are not being created because **movie events have 0 participants**.

The poll seeding logic correctly skips poll creation when events have insufficient participants:
```
[info] Skipping poll creation for 'Movie & Discussion Night Setup #1' - insufficient event participants (0)
```

**All affected movie events have 0 participants:**
- Movie & Discussion Night Setup (all instances)
- Cinema Club: Date & Movie Selection (all instances)  
- Movie Night: Pick Date & Film (all instances)
- Weekend Movie Marathon Planning (all instances)
- Drive-In Movie Event Planning (all instances)

**Other events work fine** - non-movie events have proper participant counts (15, 29, 32, etc participants).

### Timeline Analysis

❌ **The 09-06-polling branch was NOT the culprit!**

The issue existed before that branch. The "working seeds" commit (eb0353d2) from Sep 6th introduced new seed files that created movie events **without participants**, breaking the participant-dependent poll creation logic.

### Recommendation: **Option B - Continue with 09-06-polling**

The 09-06-polling branch actually contains **enhanced seed variety** with better modularization:
- ✅ `enhanced_variety_polls.exs` - Comprehensive polling scenarios
- ✅ `services/` directory - Better organized seed services  
- ✅ Better event/participant coordination logic

**Action Plan:**
1. ✅ Continue with 09-06-polling branch (more complete solution)
2. 🔧 Fix the participant seeding issue for movie events
3. 🧪 Validate RCV polls are created properly
4. ✅ Complete the refactoring with working RCV polls

The previous revert was unnecessary - the 09-06-polling branch has the right foundation, we just need to fix the participant seeding bug.
