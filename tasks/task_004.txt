# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop EventDateVote Model
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the EventDateVote model to store user votes for date options.
# Details:
Create an Ecto schema for EventDateVote with fields: id (primary key), event_date_option_id (foreign key to event_date_options), user_id (foreign key to users), and vote_type (Ecto.Enum with values :yes, :if_need_be, :no). Implement a unique constraint on (event_date_option_id, user_id) to ensure one vote per user per date. Use Ecto associations to link with EventDateOption and User models.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for the EventDateVote model, including association tests and unique constraint validation. Test CRUD operations and enum validations for vote_type.
