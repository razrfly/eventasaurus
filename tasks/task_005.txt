# Task ID: 5
# Title: Update Event Creation Flow
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the event creation process to include the option for polling.
# Details:
Update the Phoenix controller and template for event creation. Add a checkbox or toggle for 'Let attendees vote on the date.' When selected, set event.state to 'polling'. Ensure start_at and end_at are treated as the poll range. Use Phoenix.HTML.Form helpers for form creation. Implement server-side logic to create EventDateOption entries for each date in the range.

# Test Strategy:
Write integration tests using Phoenix.ConnTest to verify the new event creation flow. Test both standard and polling event creation. Verify EventDateOption entries are correctly created for polling events.
