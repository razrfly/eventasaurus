# Task ID: 11
# Title: Develop Heatmap Visualization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a heatmap visualization of aggregated voting results.
# Details:
Implement a reusable component for the heatmap visualization. Use a JavaScript library like D3.js (version 7.8.2) for advanced visualizations or Chart.js (version 3.9.1) for simpler implementations. Create a Phoenix function to aggregate vote data. Use CSS for styling the intensity-based visual indicators.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for the vote aggregation function. Create integration tests to verify the heatmap renders correctly with various data scenarios. Test responsiveness and accessibility of the visualization.
