# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Vote Persistence
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the backend logic to persist votes in the database.
# Details:
Create a Phoenix context function to handle vote submission. Use Ecto.Multi for transactional insertion of votes. Implement conflict resolution for the unique constraint on (event_date_option_id, user_id). Use Ecto.Repo.insert_all for bulk insertion if submitting multiple votes at once.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for the vote persistence function. Test various scenarios including new votes, vote updates, and conflict resolution. Verify database constraints are properly enforced.
