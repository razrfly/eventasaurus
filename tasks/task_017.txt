# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Frontend State Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 11, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a robust state management solution for the frontend.
# Details:
Use Phoenix LiveView's built-in state management capabilities. For more complex state, consider using a JavaScript solution like Zustand (version 4.3) or Recoil (version 0.7) if needed. Implement optimistic UI updates for improved user experience.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for state management logic. Implement integration tests using Phoenix.LiveViewTest to verify state consistency across user interactions.
