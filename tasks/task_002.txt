# Description: Implement the EventDatePoll model to manage polling for event dates.
# Details:
Create a new Ecto schema for EventDatePoll with fields: id (primary key), event_id (foreign key to events), created_by_id (foreign key to users), voting_deadline (utc_datetime, optional), and finalized_date (date). Use Ecto associations to link with the Event model. Implement any necessary validations using Ecto.Changeset.
