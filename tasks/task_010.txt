# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement User Identity Handling
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and refine the logic for handling user identity during the voting process, addressing current issues and completing the implementation. Major bug fixes for anonymous voting flow and N+1 query issue have been applied.
# Details:
The core components of user identity handling have been implemented, including the UserIdentityComponent, PublicEventLive voting flow, UserAuth JavaScript hook, vote data preservation, and authentication flow integration. A major bug in the anonymous voting flow has been fixed, allowing anonymous users to vote as intended. Additionally, a critical N+1 query issue and ArgumentError have been resolved, significantly improving performance and stability. Focus now on integrating these fixes, resolving remaining identified issues, completing the implementation, and ensuring all components work seamlessly together.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for the user identity handling logic, including the newly fixed anonymous voting flow and optimized vote tally function. Create integration tests to verify the full flow from vote selection to user creation/login and vote submission for both anonymous and authenticated users. Perform end-to-end testing with a real Supabase instance to ensure all components work together correctly, paying special attention to the anonymous voting process and performance improvements. Conduct load testing to verify the elimination of N+1 queries.
