# Task ID: 19
# Title: Test Anonymous Voting Flow Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Verify the N+1 query optimization and ArgumentError fixes in the anonymous voting flow by conducting thorough testing on the polling event page.
# Details:
1. Set up a test environment with a polling event that has multiple date options.
2. Ensure the database is properly seeded with test data.
3. Implement test cases using ExUnit for Elixir/Phoenix:
   a. Test anonymous user access to the polling event page.
   b. Verify the UserIdentityComponent modal appears when an anonymous user attempts to vote.
   c. Test the voting process for anonymous users, ensuring votes are properly recorded.
   d. Implement database query logging to monitor for N+1 query issues.
   e. Use tools like `ExProf` or `AppSignal` to profile the application and check for performance improvements.
4. Implement browser-based tests using Wallaby or Hound:
   a. Simulate clicking voting buttons for different date options.
   b. Verify the UserIdentityComponent modal behavior.
   c. Complete the anonymous voting process and check for successful submission.
5. Stress test the system:
   a. Simulate multiple concurrent anonymous users voting.
   b. Monitor database performance and application response times.
6. Error handling tests:
   a. Attempt to trigger the previous ArgumentError and verify it no longer occurs.
   b. Test edge cases like rapid multiple votes or invalid input.
7. Review and analyze test results:
   a. Confirm absence of N+1 query issues.
   b. Verify no ArgumentErrors or unexpected crashes occur.
   c. Ensure voting data integrity and accuracy.
8. Document any remaining issues or areas for further optimization.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Write ExUnit tests for the backend logic handling anonymous votes.
   - Mock the database calls and verify correct behavior of the optimized queries.
   - Test error handling to ensure ArgumentErrors are properly caught and managed.

2. Integration Tests:
   - Set up a test database with sample polling events and date options.
   - Use ExUnit to test the entire flow from accessing the event page to submitting a vote.
   - Verify that votes are correctly recorded in the database for anonymous users.

3. Performance Testing:
   - Use `ExProf` to profile the application during the voting process.
   - Monitor database query execution times and counts.
   - Compare performance metrics before and after the optimization.

4. Browser Tests:
   - Implement Wallaby tests to simulate user interactions:
     a. Visit the polling event page as an anonymous user.
     b. Click on voting buttons for different date options.
     c. Interact with the UserIdentityComponent modal.
     d. Complete the voting process.
   - Assert that the UI behaves correctly and no errors are displayed.

5. Load Testing:
   - Use a tool like k6 or Apache JMeter to simulate multiple concurrent anonymous users.
   - Monitor server response times and database performance under load.
   - Verify that the system remains stable and responsive.

6. Manual Testing:
   - Perform a series of manual tests covering various scenarios:
     a. Vote as an anonymous user on different browsers and devices.
     b. Attempt rapid voting and verify rate limiting if implemented.
     c. Test with network throttling to simulate poor connections.

7. Logging and Monitoring:
   - Review application logs during all test phases.
   - Use APM tools to monitor for any unexpected errors or performance issues.

8. Regression Testing:
   - Ensure that the fixes haven't introduced new bugs in related functionality.
   - Verify that authenticated user voting still works correctly.

9. Acceptance Criteria:
   - No N+1 query issues detected in logs or profiling tools.
   - No ArgumentErrors occur during any test scenario.
   - Anonymous voting flow completes successfully with votes recorded accurately.
   - Performance metrics show improvement compared to pre-optimization state.
   - UserIdentityComponent modal appears and functions as expected for anonymous users.
