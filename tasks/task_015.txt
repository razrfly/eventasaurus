# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Access Control
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop access control mechanisms for different user roles.
# Details:
Use Phoenix's built-in Plug system to implement access control. Create plugs for authenticating organizers and participants. Implement role-based access control using a library like Canada (version 2.0). Ensure organizer-only actions are properly protected.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for individual plugs. Create integration tests to verify access control across different user roles and actions. Test both allowed and disallowed scenarios.
