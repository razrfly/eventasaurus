# Task ID: 1
# Title: Update Event Model Schema
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the existing Event model to include the new 'state' field for polling functionality.
# Details:
Add a 'state' field of type string to the Event model in the database schema. Use Ecto to define the field with allowed values 'confirmed' and 'polling'. Ensure that the 'start_at' and 'end_at' fields are still required. Update any relevant Ecto schemas and migrations. Use Ecto.Enum for the state field to ensure type safety.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests to verify the new field is correctly added and validates the allowed states. Test that 'start_at' and 'end_at' remain required fields.
