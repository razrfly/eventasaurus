# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Date Range Generation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a function to generate date options within the specified range.
# Details:
Implement a Phoenix context function that takes start_at and end_at as inputs and returns a list of dates within that range. Use the Elixir Date module for date manipulation. Consider using the Timex library (version ~> 3.7) for more advanced date operations if needed.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for the date generation function, covering various scenarios including different date ranges, leap years, and edge cases.
