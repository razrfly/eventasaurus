# Title: Develop Participant Voting Interface
# Status: done

# Description: Create an interface for participants to vote on date options.
# Details:
Implement a Phoenix LiveView for the voting interface. Display date options with buttons for Yes, If need be, and No. Use Phoenix.HTML.Form for form elements. Implement client-side state management to track votes before submission. Consider using Alpine.js (version 3.x) for enhanced interactivity.
