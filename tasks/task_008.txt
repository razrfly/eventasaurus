# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Date Finalization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Allow organizers to finalize a date, updating the event state and start date.
# Details:
Add a 'Finalize Date' action to the organizer dashboard. Implement a Phoenix controller action that updates the event.state to 'confirmed', sets event.start_at to the selected date, and optionally archives vote data. Use Ecto.Multi for transactional updates across multiple models.

# Test Strategy:
Create integration tests for the date finalization process. Verify that the event state and start date are correctly updated, and that vote data is properly handled.
