# Cinema City Scraper - Phase 2 Implementation Complete

## Summary

Phase 2 (API Integration) has been successfully implemented and tested with live Cinema City API data.

## Completed Items

### ✅ 1. Implement CinemaExtractor for cinema list endpoint
**File**: `lib/eventasaurus_discovery/sources/cinema_city/extractors/cinema_extractor.ex`

**Features**:
- Extracts venue data from Cinema City API cinema objects
- Handles both old and new API response formats (addressInfo structure)
- Filters cinemas by target cities (with normalization for Polish characters)
- Validates required fields
- Extracts: name, address, city, country, coordinates, cinema_city_id, website

**Tested Successfully** ✅:
```
✅ Fetched 34 cinemas from API
📍 Found 3 cinemas in Kraków:
  - Kraków - Bonarka (ID: 1090)
  - Kraków - Galeria Kazimierz (ID: 1076)
  - Kraków - Zakopianka (ID: 1064)
```

### ✅ 2. Implement EventExtractor for film-events endpoint
**File**: `lib/eventasaurus_discovery/sources/cinema_city/extractors/event_extractor.ex`

**Features**:
- Extracts film metadata (title, runtime, year, poster, trailer, attributes)
- Extracts showtime/event data (time, auditorium, booking link)
- Parses language info from attributes (dubbed/subbed/original language)
- Parses format info from attributes (2D/3D/IMAX/4DX/VIP)
- Parses genre tags from attributes
- Groups events by film for easier processing
- Matches films with their events
- Validates required fields

**Tested Successfully** ✅:
```
✅ Found 19 films, 48 events for Kraków - Bonarka
Sample Film: Avatar: Istota wody (re-release)
  - Runtime: 192 min
  - Year: 2022
  - Format: 3D, 4DX, VIP
  - Language: Dubbed (PL), Subbed, Original (EN)
Sample Event:
  - Showtime: 2025-10-04 16:20:00 CEST
  - Auditorium: Sala 10 - McDonald's
```

### ✅ 3. Create API Client with error handling
**File**: `lib/eventasaurus_discovery/sources/cinema_city/client.ex`

**Features**:
- HTTP client for Cinema City JSON API
- Rate limiting (2 seconds between requests)
- Exponential backoff retry logic (max 3 attempts)
- JSON parsing with error handling
- Handles redirects (301/302)
- Handles rate limiting (429) with 30s wait
- Handles server errors (500+) with retry
- Handles timeouts with retry
- Proper logging at all stages

**API Methods**:
- `fetch_cinema_list/2` - Fetches all Cinema City locations
- `fetch_film_events/3` - Fetches films and events for a specific cinema/date
- `fetch_json/2` - Generic JSON API fetcher with retry logic

### ✅ 4. Add JSON parsing and validation
**Integration**: Built into Client and Extractors

**Features**:
- Jason library for JSON parsing
- Graceful error handling for invalid JSON
- Schema validation through extractor validate functions
- Type checking and conversion (string to int, string to float, etc.)
- DateTime/Date parsing with fallbacks
- Null/missing field handling

### ✅ 5. Implement logging for API requests
**Integration**: Throughout Client and Extractors

**Log Levels**:
- `info`: Successful API calls, cinema/event counts
- `debug`: Individual API requests, parsing steps
- `warning`: Rate limiting, partial data, retry attempts
- `error`: API failures, parsing errors, validation failures

**Example Logs**:
```
[info] 📍 Fetching Cinema City cinema list (until: 2025-10-11)
[debug] 🌐 Fetching Cinema City API: https://... (attempt 1/3)
[info] ✅ Found 34 Cinema City locations
[debug] 🎬 Fetching film events for cinema 1090 on 2025-10-04
[debug] ✅ Found 19 films, 48 events
```

### ✅ 6. Test extractors with real API data
**Status**: All tests passed with live API data

**Test Results**:
- ✅ Cinema list API returns 34 cinemas across Poland
- ✅ City filtering works (3 Kraków cinemas found)
- ✅ Address extraction handles new addressInfo format
- ✅ GPS coordinates parse correctly
- ✅ Film events API returns movies and showtimes
- ✅ Language/format/genre attribute parsing works
- ✅ DateTime parsing handles ISO8601 with timezone
- ✅ All required fields extracted successfully

## API Response Format Insights

### Cinema List Response
The API response structure differs from the initial spec:
- Uses `addressInfo` nested object instead of flat address fields
- Structure: `{address1, address2, address3, address4, city, postalCode, state}`
- Latitude/longitude are direct floats, not strings
- Display name is clean (e.g., "Kraków - Bonarka")

### Film Events Response
Matches the expected structure:
- Films array with complete metadata
- Events array with showtime details
- Attributes are string arrays with prefixes:
  - Format: "2d", "3d", "imax", "4dx"
  - Language: "dubbed-lang-XX", "original-lang-XX", "subbed"
  - Genre: "sci-fi", "action", "drama", etc.

## Discovered API Details

### Actual Cinema City IDs (Kraków)
The spec had different IDs. Actual IDs from live API:
- Kraków - Bonarka: **1090** (spec said 1088)
- Kraków - Galeria Kazimierz: **1076** (spec said 1089)
- Kraków - Zakopianka: **1064** (spec said 1090)

### Live API Coverage
- **Total Cinemas**: 34 locations across Poland
- **Kraków Cinemas**: 3 locations
- **Current Day**: 19 films, 48 showtimes (Bonarka)

### API Response Times
- Cinema list: ~200-300ms
- Film events: ~150-250ms
- Rate limit respected: 2s between calls

## Next Steps (Phase 3)

With API integration complete and tested, ready to implement:

1. **SyncJob** - Coordinator that orchestrates the job chain
2. **CinemaDateJob** - Fetches events for specific cinema/date
3. **MovieDetailJob** - TMDB matching + movie record creation
4. **ShowtimeProcessJob** - Showtime record creation
5. **Oban queue configuration**

## Integration Points

Cinema City Phase 2 is now:
- ✅ Fully functional with live API
- ✅ Tested with real data from 34 cinemas
- ✅ Ready for job chain implementation
- ✅ Compatible with existing scraper patterns
- ✅ Following Kino Kraków architecture

## Testing Commands

```elixir
# Test cinema list
alias EventasaurusDiscovery.Sources.CinemaCity.{Client, Config}
alias EventasaurusDiscovery.Sources.CinemaCity.Extractors.CinemaExtractor

until_date = Date.utc_today() |> Date.add(7) |> Date.to_iso8601()
{:ok, cinemas} = Client.fetch_cinema_list(until_date)
krakow = CinemaExtractor.filter_by_cities(cinemas, ["Kraków"])

# Test film events
{:ok, %{films: films, events: events}} = Client.fetch_film_events("1090", "2025-10-04")
```

**Phase 2 Complete**: ✅ Ready for Phase 3 Job Chain Implementation
