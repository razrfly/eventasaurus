defmodule EventasaurusDiscovery.Locations.CityHierarchy do
  @moduledoc """
  Runtime detection of metropolitan areas using pure geographic clustering.

  This module groups nearby cities into metropolitan areas and identifies
  primary cities based on event counts. No database changes required.

  ## Algorithm

  1. Calculate distances between all city pairs (Haversine formula)
  2. Group cities within threshold distance (default 20km)
  3. Select city with most events as primary for each cluster
  4. Aggregate statistics by metropolitan area

  ## Example

      # Paris (302 events), Paris 8 (21 events), Paris 16 (21 events)
      # All within 10km of each other -> cluster together
      # Paris becomes primary (most events)
      # Result: "Paris - 344 events (3 areas)"

  @doc """
  Aggregates city statistics by metropolitan area clusters.

  Cities within the distance threshold (default 20km) are grouped together.
  The city with the most events becomes the primary city for display.

  ## Parameters

    - `city_stats` - List of maps with `:city_id` and `:count` keys
    - `distance_threshold` - Maximum distance in km to group cities (default: 20.0)

  ## Returns

  List of aggregated statistics with structure:

        city_id: primary_city_id,
        city_name: "Paris",
        city_slug: "paris",
