defmodule EventasaurusDiscovery.Services.FreshnessHealthChecker do
  @moduledoc """
  Monitors EventFreshnessChecker effectiveness by analyzing database state.

  Calculates expected skip rate based on last_seen_at timestamps vs. threshold.
  If freshness checking works correctly, most events should be "fresh" (within threshold).

  ## Usage

      iex> FreshnessHealthChecker.check_health(source_id)
      %{
        total_events: 1234,
        fresh_events: 856,
        stale_events: 378,
        expected_skip_rate: 0.694,
        threshold_hours: 168,
        status: :healthy,
        diagnosis: "‚úÖ HEALTHY: 69.4% of events are fresh and being skipped."
      }

  ## Status Levels

  - `:healthy` - 70%+ fresh events (working correctly)
  - `:degraded` - 30-70% fresh events (partially working)
  - `:warning` - 5-30% fresh events (mostly broken)
  - `:broken` - 0-5% fresh events (completely broken)

  Check freshness health for a source using Oban job execution metrics.

  This is the CORRECT way to monitor freshness checking effectiveness.
  It compares actual job execution rate vs expected rate based on Oban history.

  Returns a map with:
  - `total_events` - Total events in system for this source
  - `detail_jobs_executed` - Detail jobs run in lookback period
  - `expected_jobs` - Expected jobs if freshness checking works (15-30% rate)
  - `execution_multiplier` - How many times more jobs ran than expected
  - `processing_rate` - Percentage of events processed per run
  - `lookback_days` - Days of history analyzed
  - `threshold_hours` - Configured threshold for this source
  - `status` - Health status atom
  - `diagnosis` - Human-readable diagnosis string
