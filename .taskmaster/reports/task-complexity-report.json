      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup process into subtasks for each technology and configuration step, such as repository creation, Elixir/Phoenix initialization, database setup, Stripe API configuration, environment setup, linting, CI/CD, and Docker integration.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple distinct technologies and best practices, each requiring configuration and validation. The breadth of setup (repo, language, framework, DB, payments, CI/CD, Docker) increases complexity, though each step is well-defined and commonly encountered in modern projects."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Core Data Models",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for each model (Event, Ticket, Order), including migrations, schema definitions, validations, associations, enums, and indexing.",
      "reasoning": "While the models themselves are standard, the need for proper associations, constraints, enums, and indexing adds moderate complexity. Each model and its requirements can be handled as a focused subtask."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Event Creation Functionality",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks for context module creation, event/ticket creation logic, validation, API endpoint implementation, error handling, and testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires both backend logic and API design, with validation and error handling. The complexity is moderate due to the need for transactional logic and integration with the data models."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Stripe Integration",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "List subtasks for Stripe library installation, API key management, checkout session creation, order model updates, webhook handling, idempotency, and testing.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating with an external payment provider introduces significant complexity, especially around security, idempotency, and asynchronous event handling. Each integration step is a logical subtask."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for order context creation, order creation logic, Stripe integration, order confirmation, API endpoints, error handling, and validation.",
      "reasoning": "The checkout flow is a critical, multi-step process involving order management, payment integration, and state transitions. Ensuring atomicity and correctness across these steps increases complexity."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for free ticket detection, bypass logic, order confirmation, identifier generation, and edge case handling.",
      "reasoning": "This is a focused extension of the checkout flow, with lower complexity since it bypasses payment but still requires careful handling of order state and tracking."

      "expansionPrompt": "List subtasks for webhook endpoint creation, event parsing, order status updates, idempotency checks, error handling, and testing.",
      "reasoning": "Webhook handling is inherently complex due to asynchronous processing, security (signature verification), and the need for idempotency and robust error handling."

      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks for each status transition, background job setup, order retrieval/filtering, cancellation/refund logic, and logging.",
      "reasoning": "Managing order state transitions and background cleanup jobs involves concurrency, data integrity, and business logic, making this moderately complex."

      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for availability checks, quantity updates, time-based constraints, validation, and concurrency handling.",
      "reasoning": "Availability logic is moderately complex due to the need for accurate, concurrent updates and enforcement of business rules."

      "expansionPrompt": "List subtasks for CRUD operations, authorization, validation for existing orders, soft delete, ticket modification, and testing.",
      "reasoning": "Event management covers a broad set of features, including authorization and business rule enforcement, which increases complexity."
