# Task ID: 1
# Title: Extend User Model and Database Schema
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Update the User model and database schema to support new profile fields, username system, and social links, including all required validations and migrations.
# Details:
Extend the existing User model in Phoenix/Ecto to include: username (string, unique, 3-30 chars, alphanumeric, underscores, hyphens), bio (text, 160 char limit), default_currency (string, default: 'USD'), instagram_handle, twitter_handle, youtube_handle, tiktok_handle, linkedin_handle (all strings), website_url (string), profile_public (boolean, default: true), timezone (string). Add unique constraint on username, URL validation for website_url and social handles, and reserved username protection (admin, api, www, etc.). Use Ecto migrations for schema changes. For validation, use Ecto.Changeset and custom validators for handle formats and reserved usernames. Migrate existing users with a script that assigns default values or prompts for required fields. Use Ecto 3.10+ and Phoenix 1.7+ for best compatibility and features.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for all new model validations and constraints. Test migration scripts with a copy of production data. Validate reserved username protection and handle format validation. Test schema changes in a staging environment before production deployment.
