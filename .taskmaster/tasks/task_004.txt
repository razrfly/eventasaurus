# Task ID: 4
# Title: Enhanced Event Insights Dashboard Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extend the existing event management insights dashboard to display PostHog analytics data with new metrics cards
# Details:
1. Update lib/eventasaurus_web/live/event_manage_live.ex to fetch analytics data:
```elixir
# In mount/3 or handle_info
analytics_data = PosthogService.get_event_analytics(event.id)
assign(socket, :analytics, analytics_data)
```
2. Modify event_manage_live.html.heex around lines 482-547 to add new analytics cards:
   - Unique visitors card with visitor count and trend
   - Registration conversion rate card (views to registrations)
   - Date poll engagement card (participation rate)
   - Ticket conversion card (views to purchases) for ticketed events
3. Use existing UI patterns and TailwindCSS classes for consistency
4. Add loading states and error handling for analytics data
5. Implement real-time updates using LiveView's handle_info for periodic refresh

# Test Strategy:
Test dashboard loads with analytics data, verify loading states work properly, test error handling when PostHog API is unavailable, validate UI consistency with existing insights cards, test real-time updates
