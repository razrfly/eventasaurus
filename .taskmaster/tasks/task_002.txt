# Task ID: 2
# Title: Public Event Page Tracking Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement PostHog event tracking for all user interactions on public event pages including page views, registrations, date voting, and ticket purchases
# Details:
1. Update lib/eventasaurus_web/live/public_event_live.ex to add tracking calls:
```elixir
# In mount/3
push_event(socket, "track_event", %{
  event: "event_page_viewed",
  properties: %{
    event_id: event.id,
    event_title: event.title,
    is_ticketed: event.is_ticketed
  }
})
```
2. Add JavaScript event listeners in the LiveView template for:
   - Event registration completion
   - Date vote submission
   - Ticket purchase completion
3. Create tracking helper functions in Alpine.js components:
```javascript
function trackEventRegistration(eventId, userType) {
  window.posthog?.capture('event_registration_completed', {
    event_id: eventId,
    user_type: userType
  });
}
```
4. Ensure tracking works for both authenticated and anonymous users

# Test Strategy:
Test each tracking event by performing actions on public event pages and verifying events appear in PostHog dashboard, validate proper event properties are sent, test with both authenticated and anonymous users
