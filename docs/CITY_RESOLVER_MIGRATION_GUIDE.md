# CityResolver Migration Guide

**Purpose:** Guide for migrating existing scrapers to use `CityResolver` for city name extraction, preventing data pollution.

**Created:** 2025-10-10
**Related Issue:** #1631

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

City data pollution affects **25% of cities in the database** (51/201 cities as of Oct 2025). Pollution includes:

- UK/US postcodes: "SW18 2SS", "90210"
- Street addresses: "13 Bollo Lane", "76 Narrow Street"
- Venue names: "The Rose and Crown Pub"
- Numeric values: "12345", "999"

**Root Cause:** Naive string parsing that blindly extracts the 2nd element of comma-split addresses without validation.

**Solution:** `CityResolver` helper module provides offline geocoding with built-in validation.

---

## 🛠️ Migration Steps

### Step 1: Add CityResolver Alias

```elixir
# At the top of your transformer module
defmodule EventasaurusDiscovery.Sources.YourSource.Transformer do
  # ... existing code

  alias EventasaurusDiscovery.Helpers.CityResolver
```

### Step 2: Replace Naive Parsing

**Before (❌ CAUSES POLLUTION):**

```elixir
defp parse_location_from_address(address) when is_binary(address) do
  parts = String.split(address, ",")

  case parts do
    [_street, city | _rest] ->
      {String.trim(city), "United States"}  # ❌ Takes 2nd element blindly

    _ ->
      {address, "United States"}  # ❌ Entire address as city!
  end
end
```

**After (✅ SAFE & VALIDATED):**

```elixir
def resolve_location(latitude, longitude, address) do
  case CityResolver.resolve_city(latitude, longitude) do
    {:ok, city_name} ->
      # Successfully resolved city from coordinates
      {city_name, determine_country(latitude, longitude)}

    {:error, reason} ->
      # Geocoding failed - use conservative fallback
      Logger.warning(
        "Geocoding failed for (#{inspect(latitude)}, #{inspect(longitude)}): #{reason}. " <>
        "Falling back to address parsing."
      )

      parse_location_from_address_conservative(address)
  end
end

# Conservative fallback - prefers nil over garbage
defp parse_location_from_address_conservative(address) when is_binary(address) do
  parts = String.split(address, ",")

  case parts do
    # Has at least 3 parts (street, city, state+zip)
    [_street, city_candidate, _state_zip | _rest] ->
      city_trimmed = String.trim(city_candidate)

      # CRITICAL: Validate city candidate before using
      case CityResolver.validate_city_name(city_trimmed) do
        {:ok, validated_city} ->
          {validated_city, "United States"}

        {:error, _reason} ->
          # City candidate failed validation
          Logger.warning(
            "Address parsing found invalid city candidate: #{inspect(city_trimmed)} " <>
            "from address: #{address}"
          )

          {nil, "United States"}
      end

    # Not enough parts or unexpected format - prefer nil
    _ ->
      Logger.debug("Could not parse city from address: #{address}")
      {nil, "United States"}
  end
end

defp parse_location_from_address_conservative(_), do: {nil, "United States"}
```

### Step 3: Update Transform Function

```elixir
def transform_event(venue_data, _options \\ %{}) do
  # ... existing code

  # OLD: {city, country} = parse_location_from_address(address)
  # NEW:
  {city, country} = resolve_location(latitude, longitude, address)

  # ... rest of transformation
end
```

### Step 4: Add Tests

```elixir
defmodule EventasaurusDiscovery.Sources.YourSource.TransformerTest do
  use ExUnit.Case, async: true

  alias EventasaurusDiscovery.Sources.YourSource.Transformer

  describe "resolve_location/3" do
    test "resolves city from valid GPS coordinates" do
      {city, country} =
        Transformer.resolve_location(40.7128, -74.0060, "123 Main St, New York, NY 10001")

      assert is_binary(city)
      assert city != nil
      assert country == "United States"
      # Should be a valid city name, not garbage
      refute city =~ ~r/^\d+$/
      refute city =~ ~r/street|road|avenue/i
    end

    test "handles missing coordinates with valid address" do
      {city, country} =
        Transformer.resolve_location(nil, nil, "123 Main Street, Chicago, IL 60601")

      assert city == "Chicago"
      assert country == "United States"
    end

    test "handles missing coordinates with invalid address" do
      {city, country} =
        Transformer.resolve_location(nil, nil, "SW18 2SS, England")

      # Should return nil rather than garbage
      assert city == nil
      assert country == "United States"
    end

    test "validates address parsing candidates" do
      # Address with postcode instead of city
      {city, country} =
        Transformer.resolve_location(nil, nil, "13 Bollo Lane, 90210, CA")

      # Should reject "90210" as invalid city
      assert city == nil
      assert country == "United States"
    end
  end
end
```

## 📋 Scrapers Requiring Migration

### Priority 1: Active Scrapers with GPS Coordinates

These scrapers have coordinates and should use CityResolver as primary method:

- [x] **GeeksWhoDrink** - ✅ Migrated (Phase 2 complete) - lib/eventasaurus_discovery/sources/geeks_who_drink/transformer.ex
- [x] **BandsInTown** - ✅ Migrated (Phase 4 complete) - lib/eventasaurus_discovery/sources/bandsintown/transformer.ex
- [x] **Ticketmaster** - ✅ Migrated (Phase 4 complete) - lib/eventasaurus_discovery/sources/ticketmaster/transformer.ex
- [x] **QuestionOne** - ✅ Migrated from Google API to conservative UK address parsing (Phase 4 complete) - lib/eventasaurus_discovery/sources/question_one/jobs/venue_detail_job.ex
- [x] **CinemaCity** - ✅ Migrated (Phase 4 complete) - lib/eventasaurus_discovery/sources/cinema_city/transformer.ex

### Already Safe (No Migration Needed)

These scrapers use safe city name handling and don't require migration:

- [x] **PubQuiz** - Uses proper database records, no raw city parsing
- [x] **Karnet** - Uses hardcoded "Kraków" (safe)
- [x] **KinoKrakow** - Uses hardcoded "Kraków" (safe)
- [x] **ResidentAdvisor** - Uses city_context.name from database (will be protected by VenueProcessor safety net)

### Phase 5: VenueProcessor Safety Net (COMPLETE)

**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Database pollution is now architecturally impossible

**Implementation:** `lib/eventasaurus_discovery/scraping/processors/venue_processor.ex`

**What it does:**
- Validates ALL city names before database insertion (Layer 2 safety net)
- Rejects postcodes, street addresses, numeric values, and other garbage
- Allows `nil` cities (prefer missing data over bad data)
- Logs detailed rejection information for debugging

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Impossible to pollute database** regardless of transformer quality
- ✅ Future scrapers automatically protected without code changes
- ✅ Existing scrapers get protection even if they have bugs
- ✅ Single point of enforcement at system boundary
- ✅ Defense in depth - two layers of validation

**Testing:** `test/eventasaurus_discovery/scraping/processors/venue_processor_city_validation_test.exs`
- 10+ comprehensive tests covering all invalid city patterns
- Integration tests with transformers
- Logging validation tests

### Priority 3: Future Scrapers

All new scrapers MUST use CityResolver from day one (see SCRAPER_MANIFESTO.md).

**Note:** Even if a future scraper forgets validation, the VenueProcessor safety net will catch it.

## 🧪 Testing Migration

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Test with real coordinates:**
   ```elixir
   mix run -e 'alias EventasaurusDiscovery.Sources.YourSource.Transformer;
   Transformer.resolve_location(40.7128, -74.0060, "123 Main St, New York, NY") |> IO.inspect'
   ```

2. **Test with missing coordinates:**
   ```elixir
   mix run -e 'alias EventasaurusDiscovery.Sources.YourSource.Transformer;
   Transformer.resolve_location(nil, nil, "123 Main St, Chicago, IL 60601") |> IO.inspect'
   ```

3. **Test with garbage data:**
   ```elixir
   mix run -e 'alias EventasaurusDiscovery.Sources.YourSource.Transformer;
   Transformer.resolve_location(nil, nil, "SW18 2SS, England") |> IO.inspect'
   ```

### Expected Results

- ✅ Valid coordinates → Real city name (not postcode/street)
- ✅ Valid address, no coordinates → Parsed city name (validated)
- ✅ Invalid address, no coordinates → `nil` (safe)
- ✅ Never returns postcodes, street addresses, or numeric values

### Database Verification

After migration, verify no new pollution:

```sql
-- Check for postcodes (UK pattern)
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM cities
WHERE name ~ '^[A-Z]{1,2}[0-9]{1,2}[A-Z]?\s*[0-9][A-Z]{2}$';

-- Check for ZIP codes (5 digits)
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM cities
WHERE name ~ '^\d{5}$';

-- Check for street addresses (starts with number + contains street keywords)
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM cities
WHERE name ~ '^\d+\s+.*(street|road|avenue|lane|drive|st|rd|ave|ln|dr)';

-- Should return 0 rows after migration!
```

## 🔍 Common Migration Issues

### Issue 1: Country Detection

**Problem:** How to determine country when using CityResolver?

**Solution:** Use coordinate-based detection or address parsing:

```elixir
defp determine_country(latitude, longitude) do
  cond do
    # US/Canada latitude range (roughly)
    latitude >= 24.0 && latitude <= 72.0 && longitude >= -170.0 && longitude <= -50.0 ->
      "United States"

    # UK latitude range
    latitude >= 49.0 && latitude <= 61.0 && longitude >= -8.0 && longitude <= 2.0 ->
      "United Kingdom"

    # Add more regions as needed
    true ->
      "Unknown"
  end
end
```

Or use the `geocoding` library's country code:

```elixir
case :geocoding.reverse(latitude, longitude) do
  {:ok, {_continent, country_code, city_name, _distance}} ->
    country_name = Countries.get(country_code) |> Map.get(:name)
    {city_name, country_name}
end
```

### Issue 2: Missing Coordinates

**Problem:** Source doesn't provide coordinates.

**Solution:** Geocode first, then use CityResolver:

```elixir
# 1. Get coordinates via Google Places API
{lat, lng} = GooglePlacesClient.geocode(venue_name, city_hint, country)

# 2. Use CityResolver with those coordinates
{city, country} = CityResolver.resolve_city(lat, lng)
```

### Issue 3: Performance Concerns

**Problem:** Is CityResolver fast enough?

**Solution:** Yes! Sub-millisecond lookups via k-d tree:

```elixir
# Benchmark
Benchee.run(%{
  "CityResolver" => fn -> CityResolver.resolve_city(40.7128, -74.0060) end,
  "Google Places API" => fn -> GooglePlacesClient.geocode(...) end
})

# Results:
# CityResolver:       ~0.1ms (100x faster, FREE)
# Google Places API:  ~100-500ms (expensive, $)
```

## 📊 Success Metrics

Track these metrics after migration:

### Data Quality Metrics

- **City Pollution Rate:** Should drop from 25% to <1%
- **Nil City Rate:** May increase (prefer nil over garbage)
- **Valid City Names:** Should increase to >98%

### Performance Metrics

- **Geocoding Speed:** CityResolver ~0.1ms vs Google Places ~100-500ms
- **API Cost Savings:** $0 with CityResolver vs $5-10/1000 with Google Places
- **Database Queries:** No change (still 1 query per event)

### Before/After Comparison

```sql
-- Before migration
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE name ~ '^\d+$') as numeric_cities,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE name ~ 'street|road|avenue|lane') as street_addresses,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE name ~ '^[A-Z]{1,2}\d{1,2}') as postcodes,
  COUNT(*) as total_cities
FROM cities;

-- After migration (goal)
-- numeric_cities: 0
-- street_addresses: 0
-- postcodes: 0
-- total_cities: [maintained or increased with valid data]
```

## 🎓 Best Practices

1. **Always validate city names** - Use `CityResolver.validate_city_name/1` even in fallback parsers
2. **Prefer nil over garbage** - Better to have missing data than invalid data
3. **Log warnings for fallbacks** - Track when geocoding fails for debugging
4. **Test with real garbage data** - Use examples from the database (postcodes, street addresses)
5. **Update tests first** - Add failing tests, then implement fix
6. **Run database checks** - Verify no pollution after migration
