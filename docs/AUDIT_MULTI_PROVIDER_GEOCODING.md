# Multi-Provider Geocoding System Audit

**Date**: October 12, 2025
**Reference Issue**: #1672
**Status**: 🔴 **CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND**

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Audit Objective**: Verify multi-provider geocoding system (Issue #1672) is recording data correctly and assess readiness for Phase 3.

**Finding**: The multi-provider geocoding system is **COMPLETELY BROKEN** for ALL 9 scrapers (100% failure rate).

**Root Cause**:
- **Resident Advisor** (1 scraper): Changed to pass scraper name string `"resident_advisor"` in commit `f305698a` - **NOW CRASHES** in `process_performers` when code tries to access `source.id` on a string
- **All Other Scrapers** (8 scrapers): Pass `source_id` (integer) or `source` (struct) - venues created but `source_scraper` is NULL

**Impact**:
- 🔥 **CRITICAL**: Resident Advisor is 100% broken - all jobs fail with `KeyError: key :id not found in: "resident_advisor"`
- ❌ Dashboard shows 177 venues as "Unknown" scraper (93% of venues)
- ❌ The 14 "resident_advisor" venues were created BEFORE the breaking change
- ❌ Cannot track which scrapers are creating venues
- ❌ Cannot analyze scraper-specific geocoding patterns
- ❌ **ALL SCRAPERS BROKEN - CANNOT MOVE TO PHASE 3**

## 🔍 Detailed Findings

### Issue 1: Missing `source_scraper` Field (CRITICAL)

**Evidence from Database**:
```sql
SELECT
  metadata->'geocoding'->>'source_scraper' as scraper_name,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM venues
GROUP BY scraper_name;
```

**Result**:
```
scraper_name         | count
---------------------|-------
NULL                 | 205   <-- "Unknown" scrapers (95%)
"resident_advisor"   | 14    <-- Only tracked scraper (7%)
```

**Total venues**: 215
**Missing scraper attribution**: 201 venues (93%)

---

### Issue 2: Dual Metadata Structure (CONFUSING)

**Discovery**: Venues store geocoding metadata in TWO locations:

1. **`metadata.geocoding_metadata`** (NEW FORMAT)
   - Created by Orchestrator (`AddressGeocoder.geocode_address_with_metadata`)
   - Contains: `provider`, `attempts`, `attempted_providers`, `geocoded_at`
   - **DOES NOT CONTAIN** `source_scraper` field initially

2. **`metadata.geocoding`** (LEGACY FORMAT)
   - Built by `MetadataBuilder` in VenueProcessor
   - Contains: `provider`, `source_scraper`, `cost_per_call`, `geocoded_at`
   - **Dashboard queries ONLY look at this field**

**Example Venue Metadata**:
```json
{
  "geocoding_metadata": {
    "attempts": 1,
    "provider": "mapbox",
    "geocoded_at": "2025-10-12T16:44:03.864916Z",
    "attempted_providers": ["mapbox"]
  },
  "geocoding": {
    "attempts": 1,
    "provider": "mapbox",
    "geocoded_at": "2025-10-12T16:44:03.864916Z",
    "source_scraper": "resident_advisor",  <-- ONLY HERE (when populated)
    "attempted_providers": ["mapbox"]
  }
}
```

**Code Location**: `venue_processor.ex:641-644`
```elixir
metadata: %{
  geocoding: final_geocoding_metadata,
  geocoding_metadata: geocoding_metadata
}
```

---

### Issue 3: Scraper Implementation Inconsistency (ROOT CAUSE)

**How `source_scraper` Should Work**:

1. Scraper calls `Processor.process_source_data(events, source_struct_or_id)`
2. Processor needs BOTH scraper name (for `source_scraper`) AND source struct (for `source.id` in performers)
3. VenueProcessor calls `MetadataBuilder.add_scraper_source(metadata, scraper_name)`
4. Metadata stored with `source_scraper` field populated

**What's Actually Happening**:

| Scraper | Call Pattern | Crash? | `source_scraper` | Grade |
|---------|-------------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| **Resident Advisor** | `Processor.process_source_data([data], "resident_advisor")` | 🔥 **YES** | N/A (crashes) | **F** |
| Geeks Who Drink | `Processor.process_source_data([data], source_id)` | ✅ No | ❌ `nil` | **F** |
| Question One | `Processor.process_source_data([data], source_id)` | ✅ No | ❌ `nil` | **F** |
| Bandsintown | `Processor.process_source_data(events, source_struct)` | ✅ No | ❌ `nil` | **F** |
| Ticketmaster | `Processor.process_source_data([data], source_struct)` | ✅ No | ❌ `nil` | **F** |
| Karnet | (Via `BaseJob.process_events(events, source_struct)`) | ✅ No | ❌ `nil` | **F** |
| Cinema City | (Via `BaseJob.process_events(events, source_struct)`) | ✅ No | ❌ `nil` | **F** |
| Kino Kraków | (Via `BaseJob.process_events(events, source_struct)`) | ✅ No | ❌ `nil` | **F** |
| PubQuiz Poland | (Via `BaseJob.process_events(events, source_struct)`) | ✅ No | ❌ `nil` | **F** |

**Overall System Grade**: **F (0%)** - ALL 9 scrapers broken (Resident Advisor crashes, others lose attribution)

**Code Evidence**:

**🔥 BROKEN (Resident Advisor)**: `resident_advisor/jobs/event_detail_job.ex:182`
```elixir
case Processor.process_source_data([event_data], "resident_advisor") do
  # ... passes string, but crashes in process_performers at line 178:
  # source.id <-- KeyError: strings don't have .id field
end
```

**Breaking Change**: Commit `f305698a` ("stats for scrapers") changed from passing `source` (struct) to `"resident_advisor"` (string), breaking all Resident Advisor jobs.

**❌ INCORRECT (Question One)**: `question_one/jobs/venue_detail_job.ex:115`
```elixir
case Processor.process_source_data([transformed], source_id) do
  # ... passes integer source_id (e.g., 123)
end
```

**❌ INCORRECT (Bandsintown)**: `bandsintown/jobs/event_detail_job.ex:232`
```elixir
case Processor.process_source_data(events_to_process, source) do
  # ... passes entire source struct
end
```

**❌ INCORRECT (BaseJob pattern)**: `base_job.ex:97`
```elixir
defp process_events(events, source) do
  Processor.process_source_data(events, source)
  # ... passes entire source struct (used by Karnet, Cinema City, etc.)
end
```

---

### Issue 4: **CRITICAL BUG**: `Processor.process_performers` Requires Source Struct

**Location**: `processor.ex:178`
**Severity**: 🔥 **CRITICAL** - Causes crashes

**Code**:
```elixir
defp process_performers(performers_data, source) do
  results =
    Enum.map(performers_data, fn performer_data ->
      # ...
      # Add source_id to performer data if not present
      attrs_with_source = Map.put_new(attrs, "source_id", source.id)  # <-- LINE 178
      PerformerStore.find_or_create_performer(attrs_with_source)
    end)
```

**Problem**: This function expects `source` to be a struct with `.id` field. If a string is passed (like `"resident_advisor"`), it crashes with:
```
** (KeyError) key :id not found in: "resident_advisor"
```

**Impact**:
- ❌ Resident Advisor jobs fail 100% of the time since commit `f305698a`
- ❌ All 251 Resident Advisor jobs discarded (3 attempts each, all failed)
- ❌ No new Resident Advisor venues can be created
- ❌ Cannot pass scraper name as string without crashing

**The Fundamental Design Conflict**:
- `process_venue` needs scraper **name** (string) for `source_scraper` metadata
- `process_performers` needs source **struct** (with `.id`) for performer attribution
- Currently, `process_source_data` accepts only ONE parameter (`source`) that must satisfy both requirements
- **This is impossible** - can't be both string and struct at the same time

---

### Issue 5: `extract_scraper_name` Function Limitation

**Code**: `processor.ex:147-161`
```elixir
defp extract_scraper_name(source) when is_integer(source) do
  # For source_id integers, we can't reliably determine scraper name
  # This will be nil and VenueProcessor will handle it
  nil
end

defp extract_scraper_name(source) when is_binary(source) do
  source
end

defp extract_scraper_name(source) when is_atom(source) do
  Atom.to_string(source)
end

defp extract_scraper_name(_), do: nil
```

**Problem**: This function returns `nil` for integer `source_id` and doesn't extract scraper name from source struct.

**Impact**: `MetadataBuilder.add_scraper_source(metadata, nil)` sets `source_scraper: nil` in the database.

---

## ✅ Phase 1 Assessment: Provider Isolation

**Status**: ✅ **WORKING** (but cannot verify scraper attribution)

**Evidence**:
- All 6 providers (Mapbox, HERE, Geoapify, LocationIQ, OpenStreetMap, Photon) tested successfully in `test/eventasaurus_discovery/geocoding/multi_provider_test.exs`
- Each provider geocodes addresses correctly in isolation
- Test suite passes all 7 provider isolation tests

**Limitation**:
- Cannot verify which scrapers are creating venues due to missing `source_scraper` field
- Cannot assess if all scrapers are properly integrated with multi-provider system

**Recommendation**: ✅ **Phase 1 is technically complete**, but scraper attribution must be fixed before claiming full success.

---

## ⚠️ Phase 2 Assessment: Fallback Chain

**Status**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY WORKING** (but not tested in production)

**Evidence**:
- Orchestrator fallback chain logic is implemented correctly
- Metadata includes `attempted_providers` array tracking fallback attempts
- Test suite validates orchestrator tries providers in priority order

**Issue**: **FALLBACK CHAIN HAS NEVER BEEN TRIGGERED IN PRODUCTION**

**Why**:
- Mapbox (primary provider) has **100% success rate** on all 215 venues
- No production failures have triggered HERE, Geoapify, LocationIQ, OpenStreetMap, or Photon
- Database query shows: `{mapbox,provided}` for 205 venues, `{mapbox}` for 14 venues

**Query**:
```sql
SELECT
  metadata->'geocoding'->>'source_scraper' as scraper_name,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  array_agg(DISTINCT metadata->'geocoding'->'attempted_providers') as providers_used
FROM venues
GROUP BY scraper_name;
```

**Result**:
```
scraper_name         | count | providers_used
---------------------|-------|-------------------
NULL                 | 205   | {mapbox,provided}  <-- 205 venues, only Mapbox used
"resident_advisor"   | 14    | {mapbox}           <-- 14 venues, only Mapbox used
```

**Recommendation**: ⚠️ **Phase 2 is partially complete**
- ✅ Fallback chain code is implemented
- ❌ Fallback chain has never been tested in production
- ❌ Need strategy to test fallback providers without waiting for Mapbox failures

---

## 🚫 Phase 3 Assessment: Readiness

**Status**: 🚫 **BLOCKED - CANNOT PROCEED**

**Blockers**:
1. **CRITICAL**: 93% of venues missing `source_scraper` attribution
2. **CRITICAL**: Cannot assess scraper-specific geocoding patterns
3. **HIGH**: Fallback chain untested in production
4. **MEDIUM**: Dual metadata structure is confusing and inconsistent

**Required Before Phase 3**:
1. ✅ Fix all 8 scrapers to pass scraper name (not source_id or struct)
2. ✅ Run migration to backfill `source_scraper` for existing 201 venues
3. ✅ Test fallback chain in production (temporary Mapbox disable or mock failures)
4. ⚠️ (Optional) Consolidate dual metadata structure into single format

## 📊 Scraper Grade Assessment

**Grading Criteria**:
- **A**: Jobs complete successfully + `source_scraper` tracked ✅
- **F**: Jobs crash OR `source_scraper` is NULL ❌

**Results**:

| Scraper | Grade | Status | Geocoding Pattern | Scraper Attribution |
|---------|-------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Resident Advisor | **F** | 🔥 **CRASH** | GPS-Provided | N/A (crashes before venue creation) |
| Geeks Who Drink | **F** | ⚠️ Silent Fail | GPS-Provided | ❌ NULL (shows as "Unknown") |
| Question One | **F** | ⚠️ Silent Fail | Deferred Geocoding | ❌ NULL (shows as "Unknown") |
| Bandsintown | **F** | ⚠️ Silent Fail | GPS-Provided | ❌ NULL (shows as "Unknown") |
| Ticketmaster | **F** | ⚠️ Silent Fail | GPS-Provided | ❌ NULL (shows as "Unknown") |
| Karnet | **F** | ⚠️ Silent Fail | Deferred Geocoding | ❌ NULL (shows as "Unknown") |
| Cinema City | **F** | ⚠️ Silent Fail | GPS-Provided | ❌ NULL (shows as "Unknown") |
| Kino Kraków | **F** | ⚠️ Silent Fail | GPS-Provided | ❌ NULL (shows as "Unknown") |
| PubQuiz Poland | **F** | ⚠️ Silent Fail | Venue-Based | ❌ NULL (shows as "Unknown") |

**Overall Grade**: **F (0%)** - ALL 9 scrapers broken
- **1 scraper** crashes (Resident Advisor)
- **8 scrapers** create venues but lose attribution

## 🔧 Recommended Fixes

### Fix 1: **URGENT** - Revert Resident Advisor to Pass Source Struct (CRITICAL)

**Priority**: 🔥 **URGENT** - Blocking production
**Effort**: 5 minutes
**Impact**: Fixes 100% failure rate for Resident Advisor

**Implementation**:

Revert commit `f305698a` change in `resident_advisor/jobs/event_detail_job.ex:182`:

**Before** (BROKEN - current code):
```elixir
case Processor.process_source_data([event_data], "resident_advisor") do
```

**After** (WORKING - reverted):
```elixir
case Processor.process_source_data([event_data], source) do
```

**Rationale**: This restores Resident Advisor to working state (venues created successfully, even though `source_scraper` will be NULL like other scrapers).

---

### Fix 2: Update Processor to Accept Both Source and Scraper Name (CRITICAL)

**Priority**: 🔴 **CRITICAL**
**Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Impact**: Fixes scraper attribution for all 9 scrapers

**The Solution**: Make `Processor.process_source_data` accept BOTH parameters:

**Update `processor.ex`**:

**Before**:
```elixir
def process_source_data(events, source) when is_list(events) do
  # ...
  source_scraper = extract_scraper_name(source)
  # ... later ...
  process_venue(venue_data, source, source_scraper)
  process_performers(performers_data, source)  # Needs source.id
end
```

**After**:
```elixir
# Accept either (source_struct) or (source_struct, scraper_name)
def process_source_data(events, source, scraper_name \\ nil) when is_list(events) do
  # Extract scraper name if not provided
  final_scraper_name = scraper_name || extract_scraper_name(source)

  # Now we have BOTH:
  # - source struct (for process_performers source.id)
  # - scraper_name string (for process_venue source_scraper)

  process_venue(venue_data, source, final_scraper_name)
  process_performers(performers_data, source)  # Uses source.id
end
```

**Update `extract_scraper_name` to handle Source struct**:
```elixir
defp extract_scraper_name(%{name: name}) when is_binary(name), do: name
defp extract_scraper_name(source) when is_integer(source), do: nil
defp extract_scraper_name(source) when is_binary(source), do: source
defp extract_scraper_name(source) when is_atom(source), do: Atom.to_string(source)
defp extract_scraper_name(_), do: nil
```

**Update All Scrapers** to pass scraper name:

**Pattern 1: Direct scraper name**:
```elixir
# Resident Advisor
Processor.process_source_data([event_data], source, "resident_advisor")

# Geeks Who Drink
Processor.process_source_data([transformed], source, "geeks_who_drink")

# Question One
Processor.process_source_data([transformed], source, "question_one")
```

**Pattern 2: Lookup from source_id**:
```elixir
# For jobs that have source_id, fetch source struct first
source = Repo.get!(Source, source_id)
Processor.process_source_data(events, source, source.name)
```

**Pattern 3: BaseJob (auto-extracts)**:
```elixir
# base_job.ex - extract_scraper_name will pull from source.name
Processor.process_source_data(events, source)  # No change needed
```

**Files to Update**:
1. `sources/processor.ex` - Update `process_source_data` signature and `extract_scraper_name`
2. `sources/resident_advisor/jobs/event_detail_job.ex:182` - Add 3rd parameter
3. `sources/geeks_who_drink/jobs/venue_detail_job.ex:170` - Fetch source struct, add 3rd parameter
4. `sources/question_one/jobs/venue_detail_job.ex:115` - Fetch source struct, add 3rd parameter
5. `sources/bandsintown/jobs/event_detail_job.ex:232` - Already has struct, add 3rd parameter
6. `sources/ticketmaster/jobs/event_processor_job.ex:141` - Already has struct, add 3rd parameter
7. `sources/base_job.ex:97` - No change (extract_scraper_name handles it)

---

### Fix 2: Backfill Migration for Existing Venues (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Priority**: 🟡 **HIGH**
**Effort**: 1 hour
**Impact**: Fixes 201 existing venues with NULL `source_scraper`

**Strategy**:

1. Query `public_events` table to find which scraper created each venue
2. Update `metadata->'geocoding'->>'source_scraper'` based on event source
3. Use JSONB update operations to preserve existing metadata

**Migration SQL**:
```sql
-- Strategy: Join venues with public_events to find scraper source
UPDATE venues v
SET metadata = jsonb_set(
  metadata,
  '{geocoding,source_scraper}',
  to_jsonb(s.name),
  true
)
FROM public_events pe
JOIN sources s ON pe.source_id = s.id
WHERE v.id = pe.venue_id
  AND (v.metadata->'geocoding'->>'source_scraper') IS NULL;
```

---

### Fix 3: Test Fallback Chain in Production (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Priority**: 🟡 **HIGH**
**Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Impact**: Validates fallback chain works in production

**Strategy Options**:

**Option 1: Temporary Mapbox Disable** (Recommended)
```elixir
# In config/runtime.exs
config :eventasaurus_discovery, :geocoding,
  providers: [
    # {:mapbox, [enabled: true]},  # TEMPORARILY DISABLED
    {:here, [enabled: true]},
    {:geoapify, [enabled: true]},
    # ...
  ]
```

**Option 2: Mock Failure Injection**
```elixir
# In Mapbox provider, add temporary failure mode
def geocode(address) do
  if System.get_env("GEOCODING_TEST_FALLBACK") == "true" do
    {:error, :test_fallback_mode}
  else
    # ... normal geocoding
  end
end
```

**Option 3: Dedicated Test Job**
- Create one-off Oban job that geocodes known addresses with Mapbox disabled
- Validate fallback chain triggers correctly
- Check `attempted_providers` includes multiple providers

**Validation**:
```sql
-- After testing, check for multi-provider attempts
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as multi_provider_attempts
FROM venues
WHERE jsonb_array_length(metadata->'geocoding'->'attempted_providers') > 1;
```

---

### Fix 4: Consolidate Dual Metadata Structure (OPTIONAL)

**Priority**: 🟢 **OPTIONAL**
**Effort**: 4-5 hours
**Impact**: Simplifies codebase, reduces confusion

**Current State**: Two metadata objects with overlapping fields
- `metadata.geocoding_metadata` (new format, from Orchestrator)
- `metadata.geocoding` (legacy format, for dashboard queries)

**Proposed State**: Single metadata object
- `metadata.geocoding` contains all fields (provider, attempts, attempted_providers, source_scraper, cost, etc.)

**Implementation**:
1. Update `VenueProcessor.insert_new_venue` to merge metadata into single object
2. Update dashboard queries to use single metadata location
3. Run migration to consolidate existing dual-structure venues

---
