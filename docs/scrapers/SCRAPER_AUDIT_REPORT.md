├── ✅ README.md
└── ✅ Test coverage
```

**Reference Implementation**: `sources/resident_advisor/`

## Conclusion

Overall, the scraper ecosystem is in **good shape** (83.3/100 average), with **Resident Advisor** and **Ticketmaster** serving as excellent examples. The main areas for improvement are:

1. **Testing** - Critical gap across all scrapers
2. **Documentation** - Need READMEs for all sources
3. **Consolidation** - Bandsintown has duplicate implementations
4. **Daily Operation Validation** - Cinema sources need testing

With the new specification in place, all future scrapers should follow the established patterns from Resident Advisor and Ticketmaster.
