# Marketing Narrative: Big Tech Severed Us From Relationships — Wombie Is the Repair

## The Core Thesis

Big tech has done everything in its power to sequester us — to remove us from the most important thing in our lives: **relationships**.

This isn't an accident. It's the business model. Every platform that promised to "connect" us was actually engineered to **isolate** us behind screens, feeding us a simulation of connection just compelling enough to keep us from seeking the real thing. The attention economy doesn't work if people are out living their lives. It only works if they're alone, scrolling, performing, comparing.

Think about what they took:

- **Facebook** turned your friendships into a feed. You stopped calling people because you already "knew" what they were up to. Except you didn't — you knew what they performed.
- **Instagram** turned your experiences into content. You stopped being present at concerts, dinners, sunsets — because the photo for your grid became more important than the moment itself.
- **TikTok** replaced your friends with an algorithm. Why make plans with real people when an infinite stream of parasocial entertainment is one thumb-scroll away?
- **Dating apps** turned meeting people into a shopping interface. Swipe, match, ghost. The human ritual of encountering someone through shared experience — at a concert, through a friend, at a neighborhood bar — was replaced by a marketplace that profits from you *never finding what you're looking for*.
- **Group chats & messaging apps** created the illusion of coordination while making it harder. "We should hang out!" dies in a 47-message thread where no one commits. The tools for planning got worse on purpose — because the platform wants you talking *about* doing things, not actually doing them.

The result: a generation that is more "connected" than any in human history and **more alone than any in human history**.

## Why This Matters for Wombie's Marketing

This isn't just a philosophical observation — it's our **positioning**. Every piece of marketing we create should be rooted in this understanding:

**We are not building another social app. We are building the antidote to what social apps did to human relationships.**

The marketing shouldn't be preachy or lecturing. It should be *recognizable*. When someone reads our messaging, the reaction should be: "Oh my god, yes. That's exactly what happened to me."

### Emotional Arc of Our Marketing

1. **Recognition** — "You feel it too, right? Something broke."
2. **Diagnosis** — "Here's what actually happened. They made being alone more convenient than being together."
3. **Permission** — "It's not your fault. The system was designed this way."
4. **Alternative** — "But it doesn't have to be this way. Here's something different."
5. **Invitation** — "Your real life is waiting. Come find it."

## Specific Marketing Angles to Develop

### Angle 1: "The Isolation Was Engineered"

Big tech didn't just fail to connect us — they actively profited from our isolation. Every feature that keeps you scrolling alone is a feature that keeps you from being with people. This is a design choice, not a bug.

**Potential headlines:**
- "They made being alone more convenient than being together. On purpose."
- "Your loneliness is someone else's business model."
- "The most radical thing you can do in 2026 is show up."

### Angle 2: "Relationships Need Proximity, Not Platforms"

Relationships — real ones — require physical presence. They require showing up, being awkward, sharing space, doing things together. No amount of likes, DMs, or emoji reactions is a substitute for sitting next to someone at a film.

Wombie's entire product exists to collapse the distance between "I should see people" and "I'm actually with people right now."

**Potential headlines:**
- "You can't hug a like button."
- "Friendship isn't a notification."
- "The best relationships happen in person. We just help you get there."

### Angle 3: "The Friends-of-Friends Economy"

Before social media, you met people through people. Your friend's friend at a dinner party. Someone's cousin at a wedding. The person sitting next to your roommate at a concert. This is how human social networks actually grow — through **shared experience with trusted proximity**.

Big tech replaced this with algorithmic suggestions based on surveillance data. Wombie brings back the organic way: you see what your friends are doing, and their friends, and you show up. Real connections through real experiences.

### Angle 4: "Your Attention Was Stolen. Take Your Life Back."

The average person spends 2+ hours/day on social media. That's 30 days a year staring at other people's curated lives instead of living your own. What if you redirected even a fraction of that time toward actually *doing things* with *actual people*?

Wombie is designed to get you OFF your phone and INTO your life. We measure success by time spent in the app going DOWN while events attended goes UP.

## How This Connects to What We've Built

This narrative isn't theoretical — it maps directly to product decisions we've already made:

| Big Tech Pattern | Wombie's Counter-Move | Product Feature |
|---|---|---|
| Infinite scroll to maximize screen time | No feed. Just events happening near you. | Activity discovery, city pages |
| Public metrics (likes, followers) to drive performance | No follower counts, no public engagement metrics | By design — we don't track this |
| Algorithmic feed to create addiction | You choose who sees what. Concentric circles, not algorithms. | Event visibility controls |
| Data sold to advertisers | Privacy-first. Your social graph is yours. | No ad model, no data sales |
| Features that reward *posting about* life over *living* it | Features that reward showing up | North star: events attended/user/month |
| Making coordination deliberately hard | Making coordination dead simple | Event creation, RSVP, Open to Meeting |

## Notes

The tone here is deliberately sharp — closer to a manifesto than a marketing brief. The actual customer-facing copy should modulate: warm, not angry. Inviting, not preachy. The insight ("big tech isolated us") is the foundation, but the message is hope ("there's a better way and it already exists").

People don't need to be convinced that social media failed them. They already know. What they need is **proof that an alternative exists** and **permission to try it**.
