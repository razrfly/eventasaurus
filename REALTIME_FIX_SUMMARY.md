# Real-Time Updates Fix Summary

## The Issue
LiveComponents don't support `handle_info` callbacks directly. This is why real-time updates weren't working.

## The Fix
1. **Parent LiveView** (PublicEventLive) handles all PubSub messages
2. When poll stats update, the parent **reloads all poll data**
3. The parent passes fresh data to child components via `update` callback
4. Components re-render with new data automatically

## What to Look For in Logs
When you vote, you should see:
1. "DEBUG: Getting poll voting stats for poll X"
2. "DEBUG: Broadcasted poll stats update"
3. "DEBUG: PublicEventLive received poll_stats_updated"
4. "DEBUG: VotingInterfaceComponent update called"

## Test Now
1. Start server: `mix phx.server`
2. Open same poll in 2 browser tabs
3. Vote in one tab
4. The other tab should now update automatically!

The key insight: LiveComponents can't receive PubSub messages directly, but they DO update when their parent updates their assigns.
