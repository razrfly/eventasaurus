# Fix Sortiraparis Limit Logic Bug - Phase 3.5

**Status**: 🔴 In Progress
**Priority**: High
**Related Issue**: #1835 - Add French Translation Support to Sortiraparis Scraper
**Created**: 2025-10-18

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 3 of issue #1835 implemented bilingual content fetching correctly, but a critical bug in the limit logic prevents French translations from being saved to the database. The issue is a simple placement error: the limit is applied to URL entries BEFORE grouping by article_id, which breaks the pairing of English and French URLs.

**Impact**: Zero (0) events have French translations despite all infrastructure being in place.

**Fix Complexity**: Simple - move 2 lines of code from one location to another (5 minutes)

**Assessment Grade**: B- (70/100) → Expected A (95/100) after fix

## Problem Analysis

### How Sortiraparis Works with English and French

**Sitemap Structure**:
- Separate sitemaps: `sitemap-en-*.xml` (English) and `sitemap-fr-*.xml` (French)
- Same event appears in both with consistent article_id (e.g., 319282)

**URL Patterns**:
- English: `https://www.sortiraparis.com/en/articles/319282-event-name`
- French: `https://www.sortiraparis.com/articles/319282-event-name` (no `/en/`)

**Current Implementation**:
- ✅ Fetch both sitemaps → Get mixed list of EN + FR URLs
- ✅ Group by article_id → Pair matching URLs together
- ✅ Schedule ONE job per article with both URLs
- ❌ **BUG**: Limit applied before grouping breaks pairing

### Root Cause

**Location**: `sync_job.ex:189-195`

**Current Code (BROKEN)**:
```elixir
# Apply limit if specified (limit unique URLs, not entries)
limited_entries =
  if limit do
    Enum.take(event_entries, limit)  # ❌ Takes first N URL entries
  else
    event_entries
  end

Logger.info(...)
{:ok, limited_entries}
```

**What Happens with `limit => 1`**:
1. Sitemap extraction finds 5,846 event URL entries (both EN and FR mixed)
2. `Enum.take(event_entries, 1)` takes ONLY the first URL entry
3. If first entry is English, we never see the French version
4. Grouping function receives only 1 URL entry → creates 1 single-language article
5. Job scheduled with `languages: ["en"]` and `secondary_url: null`

**Expected Behavior**:
- Limit should apply to UNIQUE ARTICLES, not URL entries
- If `limit => 1`, we should get 1 article with BOTH EN + FR URLs (2 URL entries)
- Jobs should have `languages: ["en", "fr"]` and `secondary_url: "https://...fr..."`

### Database Evidence

**Query Results** (last 10 minutes of scraping):
```sql
total_events: 12
with_french: 0        # ❌ Expected: 11-12
with_english: 12
with_both: 0          # ❌ Expected: 11-12
```

**Oban Job Analysis**:
```sql
total_jobs: 101
with_secondary_url: 0      # ❌ Expected: ~90-100
bilingual_jobs: 0          # ❌ Expected: ~90-100
single_language_jobs: 101  # ❌ Expected: ~10
```

**Sample Job Args**:
```json
{
  "url": "https://www.sortiraparis.com/en/what-to-see-in-paris/shows/articles/335322-...",
  "secondary_url": null,  // ❌ Expected: French URL
  "event_metadata": {
    "bilingual": false,   // ❌ Expected: true
    "languages": ["en"],  // ❌ Expected: ["en", "fr"]
    "article_id": "335322"
  }
}
```

## Why Not Asynchronous Matching?

### Question: Can We Schedule French and English Jobs Separately?

**Short Answer**: No, not with current database architecture.

**Database Constraint**:
```sql
UNIQUE (source_id, external_id)
```

**External ID Format**: `sortiraparis_{article_id}_{date}` (e.g., "sortiraparis_319282_2026-02-25")

**What Would Happen**:
1. French job runs first → Creates event with external_id "sortiraparis_319282_2026-02-25"
2. English job runs later → Tries to create event with SAME external_id
3. Database rejects: "duplicate key value violates unique constraint"

**To Make Asynchronous Work Would Require**:
1. Language-suffixed external IDs: `sortiraparis_319282_2026-02-25_fr`
2. New unique constraint allowing multiple records per article
3. Complex merge logic in EventProcessor to find and update existing records
4. Race condition handling (simultaneous creation)

**Conclusion**: Synchronous paired fetching is the correct architectural choice. It works with existing database structure and is simpler/more reliable.

## Should We Start Over?

**Answer**: Absolutely NOT.

**What's Working (95% of Implementation)** ✅:
- `client.ex`: Language localization implemented correctly (~70 lines)
- `event_detail_job.ex`: Bilingual fetching logic implemented correctly (~80 lines)
- `transformer.ex`: Translation merging implemented correctly (~30 lines)
- `sync_job.ex` grouping logic: Groups by article_id correctly
- `sync_job.ex` scheduling logic: Sets secondary_url correctly

**What's Broken (5% of Implementation)** ❌:
- `sync_job.ex` limit placement: Applied before grouping instead of after (2 lines)

**Comparison**:
- Fix current code: 5 minutes
- Start over: 2-4 hours to re-implement ~250 lines of correct code

## Solution: Phase 3.5

### Phase 3.5.1: Fix Limit Logic Bug ✅ COMPLETED

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Root cause identified: limit applied before grouping
2. ✅ All other components verified working
3. ✅ Remove limit from `sync_job.ex:189-195` (fetch_event_urls_from_sitemaps)
4. ✅ Add limit to `filter_fresh_events/1` after grouping (around line 254)
5. ✅ Update comments for clarity
6. ✅ Commit fix with explanation (commit 1bc21fe2)

**Result**: Limit now correctly applied to articles instead of URL entries.

### Phase 3.5.2: Fix URL Filter for French URLs 🔄 IN PROGRESS

**Discovery**: After fixing the limit logic, testing revealed a SECOND critical bug:

**Problem**: The `is_event_url?/1` function in `config.ex` was rejecting ALL French URLs.

**Root Cause**:
- The filter checked for English category keywords: `"shows"`, `"exhibit-museum"`, `"concerts-music-festival"`, `"theater"`
- English URLs: `/en/what-to-see-in-paris/shows/articles/319282-event` ✅ Contains "shows"
- French URLs: `/scenes/spectacle/articles/319282-event` ❌ No English keywords

**Impact**:
- Out of 5,846 total article URLs extracted from sitemaps
- Only 2 articles had both languages (0.03%)
- Expected: ~8,601 articles with both languages (147% more)

**Evidence**:
```bash
# Testing URL filter
is_event_url?("https://www.sortiraparis.com/en/articles/326487-test") → false
is_event_url?("https://www.sortiraparis.com/articles/326487-test") → false

# Checking actual overlap
English sitemap 1: 585 article IDs
French sitemap 1: 824 article IDs
Overlap: 491 articles with both languages (84% of English)

# After fetching ALL sitemaps
Total English articles: ~5,846
Total French articles: ~8,601
Expected bilingual overlap: ~8,601 articles
Actual bilingual articles after filter: 2 (99.98% lost!)
```

**Fix**:
Changed URL detection from category keywords to article ID pattern:

```elixir
# BEFORE (English-only keywords):
def is_event_url?(url) do
  has_event_category = Enum.any?(["shows", "exhibit-museum", ...], &String.contains?(url, &1))
  has_exclude_pattern = Enum.any?(exclude_patterns(), &String.contains?(url, &1))
  has_event_category and not has_exclude_pattern
end

# AFTER (Language-agnostic pattern):
def is_event_url?(url) do
  # Check for /articles/{digits}- pattern (works for both EN and FR)
  has_article_pattern = Regex.match?(~r{/articles/\d+-}, url)
  has_exclude_pattern = Enum.any?(exclude_patterns(), &String.contains?(url, &1))
  has_article_pattern and not has_exclude_pattern
end
```

**Why This Works**:
- Both English and French URLs have `/articles/{article_id}-` pattern
- English: `/en/what-to-see-in-paris/shows/articles/319282-event`
- French: `/scenes/spectacle/articles/319282-event`
- Article ID pattern is consistent across all languages

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Discovered French URLs being filtered out
2. ✅ Identified category keyword mismatch between languages
3. ✅ Verified article ID pattern exists in both languages
4. ✅ Updated `is_event_url?/1` to use regex pattern matching
5. ⏳ Test with limit => 1 to verify bilingual jobs
6. ⏳ Commit fix with explanation

### Exact Code Changes

**File**: `lib/eventasaurus_discovery/sources/sortiraparis/jobs/sync_job.ex`

**Change 1** (Lines 189-200) - Remove limit from fetch_event_urls_from_sitemaps:

```elixir
# BEFORE:
# Apply limit if specified (limit unique URLs, not entries)
limited_entries =
  if limit do
    Enum.take(event_entries, limit)
  else
    event_entries
  end

Logger.info(...)
{:ok, limited_entries}

# AFTER:
# DON'T apply limit here - we need ALL URLs to ensure complete language pairs
# Limit will be applied to ARTICLES (not URL entries) in filter_fresh_events/1
Logger.info(...)
{:ok, event_entries}
```

**Change 2** (After line 254) - Add limit to filter_fresh_events:

```elixir
# Add this after the article_count variable (around line 254):

# Apply limit to ARTICLES (not URL entries)
# This ensures we get complete language pairs for each article
limited_articles = if limit do
  Enum.take(articles_list, limit)
else
  articles_list
end

Logger.info("""
✨ Article Processing:
- Total articles available: #{article_count}
- Articles to process (after limit): #{length(limited_articles)}
- Deduplication: Handled by database constraints
""")

{:ok, limited_articles}
```

### Why This Fix Works

**Before Fix** (with `limit => 1`):
1. Fetch 5,846 URL entries (mixed EN/FR)
2. ❌ Apply limit → Take 1 URL entry (English only)
3. Group → `%{"319282" => %{"en" => "url"}}`
4. Schedule job with `secondary_url: null`

**After Fix** (with `limit => 1`):
1. Fetch 5,846 URL entries (mixed EN/FR)
2. Group → `%{"319282" => %{"en" => "url1", "fr" => "url2"}, ...}` (~2,923 articles)
3. ✅ Apply limit → Take 1 article (with BOTH languages)
4. Schedule job with `secondary_url: "...fr..."` and `bilingual: true`

---

## Testing Plan

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (30 minutes)

1. **Test with `limit => 1`**:
   - Verify 1 job scheduled with `bilingual: true`
   - Verify `secondary_url` is set
   - Check database: `description_translations` has both `"en"` and `"fr"` keys

2. **Test with `limit => 5`**:
   - Verify 5 jobs scheduled, all bilingual
   - Check database: All 5 events have both translations
   - Verify translation quality (French is actually in French, not English duplicate)

3. **Test single-language fallback**:
   - Verify jobs with only one language still work
   - Check backward compatibility

4. **Verify no duplicates**:
   - Check that same article_id creates ONE event, not two
   - Verify external_id uniqueness

### Phase 5: Production Readiness (1 hour)

1. **Full scrape without limit**:
   - Expected: ~2,923 articles (5,846 URLs ÷ 2 languages)
   - Monitor progress and error rates

2. **Monitor bot protection**:
   - Expected: ~30% of requests return 401
   - Verify retry logic handles this gracefully

3. **Translation quality check**:
   - Sample 10 random events
   - Verify English text is in English
   - Verify French text is in French (not duplicates)

4. **Performance assessment**:
   - Bilingual fetching = 2x requests per event
   - Verify acceptable performance with rate limiting

### Phase 6: Documentation & Closure (15 minutes)

1. Update `PHASE3_ASSESSMENT.md` with final grade (B- → A)
2. Update GitHub issue #1835 with fix details
3. Close issue #1835 ✅
4. Create follow-up issues if needed (e.g., bot protection improvements)

---

## Success Metrics

**Must Pass Before Closing**:
1. ✅ Jobs scheduled with `secondary_url` when both languages available
2. ✅ Database has `description_translations` with both `"en"` and `"fr"` keys
3. ✅ ≥90% of events have both translations (target: 95%+)
4. ✅ Translation quality verified (French text is actually French)
5. ✅ No duplicate events (same article_id creates ONE event)

**Expected Results**:
- With `limit => 1`: 1 event with both translations
- With `limit => 5`: 5 events with both translations
- Without limit: ~2,923 events with both translations

- **Phase 3.5**: Fix limit logic (15 minutes)
- **Phase 4**: Testing & Validation (30 minutes)
- **Phase 5**: Production Readiness (1 hour)
- **Phase 6**: Documentation & Closure (15 minutes)

**Total**: ~2 hours from start to completion
