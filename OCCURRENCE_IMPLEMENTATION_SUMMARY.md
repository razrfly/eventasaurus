# Occurrence Display Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented occurrence display functionality for consolidated events in the show view, addressing GitHub issue #1191.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Bug Fix: False Positive Occurrences
- **Problem**: 203 single events incorrectly had occurrences (57% false positive rate)
- **Root Cause**: Line 235 in `event_processor.ex` was initializing ALL events with occurrences
- **Solution**: Removed automatic occurrence initialization for single events
- **Result**: Now only 7 events (1.9%) have genuine occurrences

### 2. Database Cleanup
- Created migration `20250922192430_cleanup_single_event_occurrences.exs`
- Cleaned up 203 false positive occurrences
- Verified only genuine recurring events remain

### 3. Index Page UI Indicators
Added visual indicators for recurring events in `public_events_index_live.ex`:
- Green ring border for recurring event cards
- Badge showing number of dates (e.g., "61 dates")
- Stacked shadow effect for list view
- Helper functions: `occurrence_count/1`, `recurring?/1`, `frequency_label/1`

### 4. Show Page Occurrence Selection
Enhanced `public_event_show_live.ex` with smart occurrence display:

#### Display Strategies by Type:
1. **Daily Shows (>20 dates)** - e.g., Muzeum Banksy
   - Calendar grid view with clickable date buttons
   - Shows: "61 shows from Sept 23 to Nov 22"
   - Scrollable 7-column layout

2. **Same Day Multiple Times** - e.g., Disturbed concert
   - Time selector list (3:30 PM, 8:00 PM)
   - Full-width buttons with optional labels
   - Perfect for matinee/evening shows

3. **Multi-Day Events (2-7 dates)** - e.g., Hollywood in Dance
   - Date list with full datetime display
   - Clear selection indication
   - Ideal for short-run events

#### Technical Implementation:
- Added `selected_occurrence` to LiveView socket
- Parse occurrences from JSONB to structured format
- Smart default selection (next upcoming date)
- Interactive selection with `handle_event("select_occurrence")`
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Files Modified

### Core Files:
1. `lib/eventasaurus_discovery/scraping/processors/event_processor.ex`
   - Removed automatic occurrence initialization
   - Cleaned up unused helper functions

2. `lib/eventasaurus_discovery/public_events/public_event.ex`
   - Added occurrence helper functions
   - Occurrence counting and labeling logic

3. `lib/eventasaurus_web/live/public_events_index_live.ex`
   - Added recurring event indicators
   - Fixed nil category bug in `build_path`

4. `lib/eventasaurus_web/live/public_event_show_live.ex`
   - Complete occurrence selection UI
   - Smart display type detection
   - Date/time formatting helpers

### Migration:
- `priv/repo/migrations/20250922192430_cleanup_single_event_occurrences.exs`
  - Removes single occurrences (count = 1)
  - Cleans empty occurrence structures

## Test URLs

Test the implementation with these events:

1. **Muzeum Banksy** (61 dates)
   - http://localhost:4000/activities/muzeum-banksy-651
   - Should show calendar grid view

2. **Disturbed Concert** (2 times same day)
   - http://localhost:4000/activities/disturbed-the-sickness-25th-anniversary-tour-enhanced-experiences-689
   - Should show time selection

3. **Bing na Żywo** (3 shows same day)
   - http://localhost:4000/activities/bing-na-zywo-wielkie-urodziny-862
   - Should show time selection list

4. **Hollywood in Dance** (2 consecutive days)
   - http://localhost:4000/activities/hollywood-in-dance-episode-ii-w-ice-krakow-528
   - Should show date list

## Metrics

### Before Fix:
- Total Events: 367
- With Occurrences: 210 (57.2% - FALSE)
- Real Recurring: 7 (1.9%)

### After Fix:
- Total Events: 367
- With Occurrences: 7 (1.9% - CORRECT)
- All occurrences genuine (2-61 dates each)

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. Wire selected occurrence to ticket URL generation
2. Add timezone display/conversion
3. Add "Sold Out" indicators per occurrence
4. Add loading states for occurrence fetching
5. Consider pagination for very long date lists
6. Add calendar widget for better UX on 30+ date events

## Success Criteria Met

✅ Users can see when an event has multiple occurrences
✅ Users can select their preferred date/time
✅ Different display strategies for different occurrence patterns
✅ Mobile-friendly date selection
✅ Clean, intuitive UI that matches existing design
✅ No performance impact (parsing done on mount)
✅ Search/filter still works correctly
