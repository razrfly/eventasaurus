# Crypto-Native Event Platform Features for World Build Application

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Transform Eventasaurus into a crypto-native event platform leveraging World App's 30M+ verified human audience. This proposal outlines smart contract-based event funding, conditional payments, and decentralized ticketing features that go far beyond basic crypto payment acceptance.

**Key Differentiators:**
- Smart contract-based event funding (Kickstarter for events)
- Conditional payment releases based on milestone criteria
- Verifiable human participation via World ID integration
- Decentralized ticket NFTs with resale mechanisms
- Cross-border payments with crypto rails
- Community-driven event funding with governance

## 🌍 World Build Program Alignment

**Target Audience:** World App's 30M+ verified users seeking transparent, community-driven event experiences

**Problem Solved:** Current event platforms (including Luma) only support basic crypto payments. We enable sophisticated smart contract-based event funding with transparent conditions, milestone-based releases, and verifiable human participation.

**Scale Potential:** Mini-app integration with World Network's growing verified human base, enabling global event coordination with built-in fraud prevention.

## 🔧 Current Platform Foundation

Eventasaurus already provides a robust foundation:

- **Event Lifecycle Management:** Draft → Polling → Threshold → Confirmed → Canceled
- **Stripe Integration:** Advanced payment processing with Connect accounts
- **Ticketing System:** Flexible pricing models, multi-ticket types, QR verification
- **Real-time Features:** LiveView-powered updates, polling systems
- **Group Coordination:** Member management, roles, democratic decision-making

## 🚀 Proposed Crypto-Native Features

### 1. Smart Contract Event Funding (Primary Feature)

**Concept:** Transform event creation into smart contract-based crowdfunding campaigns with transparent conditions and milestone-based fund releases.

#### Core Components

**A. Event Funding Contracts**
```solidity
// Conceptual smart contract structure
contract EventFunding {
    enum FundingStatus { Draft, Active, Successful, Failed, Canceled }
    
    struct Event {
        address organizer;
        uint256 targetAmount;
        uint256 minimumParticipants;
        uint256 deadline;
        bytes32[] milestones;
        FundingStatus status;
    }
    
    struct Milestone {
        string description;
        uint256 releaseAmount;
        bool completed;
        uint256 votesRequired;
    }
}
```

**B. Funding Models**

1. **Threshold Funding (Kickstarter Model)**
   - Set minimum funding goal and participant count
   - Funds only released when both thresholds met
   - Automatic refunds if goals not reached by deadline
   - Organizers can set bonus tiers for over-funding

2. **Milestone-Based Release**
   - Funds released in stages based on completion criteria
   - Community voting on milestone completion
   - Transparent fund allocation and usage tracking
   - Dispute resolution through decentralized arbitration

3. **Conditional Payments**
   - Weather-dependent outdoor events
   - Speaker/performer availability
   - Venue confirmation
   - Minimum quality scores from attendees

**C. Technical Implementation**

- **Smart Contract Layer:** Ethereum/Polygon contracts for fund management
- **World ID Integration:** Verified human participation, prevent sybil attacks
- **Database Integration:** Link contract addresses to existing Event models
- **Real-time Sync:** Monitor blockchain events, update platform state
- **Fallback Systems:** Hybrid crypto/fiat options for broader adoption

### 2. Decentralized Ticketing & NFTs

**A. NFT-Based Tickets**
- Unique, verifiable event tickets as NFTs

- Revenue sharing for successful events
- Reputation systems for reliable attendees

### 3. Cross-Border & DeFi Integration

**A. Global Payments**
- Accept payments in multiple cryptocurrencies
- Automatic conversion to organizer's preferred currency
- Reduced fees compared to traditional international transfers
- Real-time settlement without banking delays

**B. Yield Generation**
- Stake deposited funds in DeFi protocols during event planning phase
- Generated yield reduces ticket prices or enhances event quality
- Transparent yield distribution to participants

### 4. Reputation & Identity Systems

- Build trust through verified human identity
- Enable global reputation portability
- Support age verification and compliance requirements

**B. On-Chain Reputation**
- Immutable attendance records
