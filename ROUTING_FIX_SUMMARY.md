# Routing Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The login and register pages were not loading at `http://localhost:4000/login` and `http://localhost:4000/register`. Instead, these URLs were being caught by the PublicEventLive catch-all route `live "/:slug", PublicEventLive`, which was treating "login" and "register" as event slugs.

## Root Cause

The router had a catch-all route that was too broad:

```elixir
# This catch-all route was capturing /login and /register
live "/:slug", PublicEventLive
```

This route was placed in a way that intercepted common authentication paths before they could reach the proper auth routes at `/auth/login` and `/auth/register`.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Direct Route Redirects

Added specific routes for the common authentication paths that redirect to the proper auth routes:

```elixir
# In router.ex - added to the public routes section
get "/login", PageController, :redirect_to_auth_login
get "/register", PageController, :redirect_to_auth_register
```

### 2. Added Redirect Functions

Added redirect functions to `PageController`:

```elixir
def redirect_to_auth_login(conn, _params) do
  redirect(conn, to: ~p"/auth/login")
end

def redirect_to_auth_register(conn, _params) do
  redirect(conn, to: ~p"/auth/register")
end
```

### 3. Created Failing Tests First

Created integration tests that demonstrated the problem:
- `/login` was redirecting to home instead of loading login page
- `/register` was redirecting to home instead of loading register page

### 4. Updated Tests to Match Solution

Updated the tests to verify the correct behavior:
- `/login` redirects to `/auth/login` (302 status)
- `/register` redirects to `/auth/register` (302 status)
- Following the redirects loads the proper authentication pages

## Verification Results

### ✅ Manual Testing
- `curl -I http://localhost:4000/login` returns 302 redirect to `/auth/login`
- `curl -I http://localhost:4000/register` returns 302 redirect to `/auth/register`
- Final destinations load correctly with proper HTML content

### ✅ Automated Testing
- **72 tests, 0 failures**
- Integration tests verify redirect behavior
- All existing functionality preserved

### ✅ User Experience
- Users can now access login/register using intuitive URLs
- `/login` and `/register` work as expected
- Proper auth pages load with full functionality

## Benefits

1. **Intuitive URLs**: Users can type `/login` and `/register` directly
2. **SEO Friendly**: Common authentication paths work as expected
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing `/auth/login` and `/auth/register` routes still work
4. **Clean Architecture**: Catch-all route preserved for actual event slugs
5. **Test Coverage**: Integration tests prevent regression

## Files Modified

- `lib/eventasaurus_web/router.ex` - Added redirect routes
- `lib/eventasaurus_web/controllers/page/page_controller.ex` - Added redirect functions
- `test/eventasaurus_web/integration/route_integration_test.exs` - Added comprehensive tests

The fix maintains the existing architecture while providing user-friendly access to authentication pages.
