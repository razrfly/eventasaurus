========================================
Venue UTF-8 Protection Test Results
========================================

✅ Venue slug generation handles error tuples
✅ Broken UTF-8 strings in venue names are cleaned
✅ Broken UTF-8 in addresses is cleaned
✅ Valid UTF-8 with special characters is preserved
✅ Nested venue metadata is sanitized

The universal solution now protects:
- PublicEvent data (events from all scrapers)
- Venue data (venues from all scrapers)
- All string fields in both models
- Slug generation in both models

This ensures no UTF-8 errors can reach the database
from any scraper through any data path.
