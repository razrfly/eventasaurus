# Test Suite Audit & Refactoring PRD
## Eventasaurus Test Quality Improvement Initiative

### Project Overview
Refactor and audit the current test suite of 417 tests across 36 test files to create a maintainable, reliable, and efficient testing system. Currently experiencing 40 test failures and significant technical debt in test organization.

### Current State Analysis
- **Test Count**: 417 tests across 36 files
- **Failure Rate**: 40 failures (9.6% failure rate) 
- **Test Categories Identified**:
  - Integration tests (Wallaby-based feature tests)
  - LiveView component tests
  - Context/business logic tests
  - Authentication flow tests
  - Registration flow tests
  - API endpoint tests

### Business Goals
1. **Reduce Test Maintenance Burden**: Cut test execution time by 50%
2. **Improve Reliability**: Achieve 100% test pass rate
3. **Enhance Developer Experience**: Clear test categories and fast feedback loops
4. **Future-Proof Architecture**: Scalable test organization for rapid feature development

### Technical Requirements

#### 1. Test Classification System
Implement a comprehensive tagging and organization system:

**Core Test Categories:**
- `@tag :unit` - Fast, isolated unit tests (< 10ms each)
- `@tag :integration` - Integration tests between components
- `@tag :feature` - End-to-end user journey tests (Wallaby)
- `@tag :auth` - Authentication and authorization tests
- `@tag :slow` - Tests requiring external services or heavy setup
- `@tag :broken` - Currently failing tests to be fixed or removed

**Domain-Specific Tags:**
- `@tag :events` - Event management functionality
- `@tag :registration` - User registration flows
- `@tag :admin` - Administrative functionality
- `@tag :public` - Public-facing features
- `@tag :api` - API endpoint tests

#### 2. Test Audit Methodology
**Phase 1: Automated Analysis**
- Generate test execution timing report
- Identify duplicate test scenarios
- Map test dependencies and setup requirements
- Categorize tests by failure patterns

**Phase 2: Manual Review Process**
- Evaluate test value vs. maintenance cost
- Identify overlapping test coverage
- Document business-critical test scenarios
- Flag tests that don't align with current architecture

**Phase 3: Classification & Prioritization**
- **Keep**: High-value, maintainable tests
- **Refactor**: Valuable tests needing cleanup
- **Merge**: Duplicate tests to be consolidated
- **Remove**: Low-value or obsolete tests

#### 3. Test Infrastructure Improvements

**Test Performance Optimization:**
- Implement test database seeding strategies
- Optimize Factory/fixture usage
- Introduce test data caching for expensive setups
- Separate fast unit tests from slow integration tests

**Test Organization:**
```

```

#### 4. Specific Phoenix/Elixir Testing Best Practices

**LiveView Testing Strategy:**
- Use `render_component/2` for isolated component tests
- Use `live/2` and `live_isolated/3` for full LiveView integration
- Implement proper async test patterns with SQL Sandbox
- Mock external services consistently

**Authentication Testing Patterns:**
- Standardized user creation and login helpers
- Consistent session management across tests
- Proper cleanup of authentication state

**Database Testing Optimization:**
- Use `ExUnit.Case` async: true wherever possible
- Implement proper transaction rollback strategies
- Optimize factory creation for common scenarios

#### 5. Test Execution Strategy

**Multi-Tier Test Execution:**
```bash
# Fast feedback loop (< 30 seconds)
mix test --only unit

# Integration testing (< 2 minutes)  
mix test --only integration

# Full feature testing (< 5 minutes)
mix test --only feature

# Complete test suite
mix test
```

**CI/CD Integration:**
- Parallel test execution by category
- Fail-fast on unit test failures
- Detailed reporting on test performance regressions

#### 6. Test Quality Metrics

**Success Criteria:**
- 100% test pass rate
- Unit tests execute in < 30 seconds
