## 🎯 Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Image Storage Bug

**Problem**: Hero image URLs were extracted from venue pages but never stored in the database.

**Solution**: Added image storage to transformer with validation.

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/eventasaurus_discovery/sources/quizmeisters/transformer.ex`
  - Line 104: Added `image_url` field to transformed event
  - Lines 297-315: Added `validate_image_url/1` function with placeholder filtering

### 2. Added Image Validation Tests

**Files Modified**:
- `test/eventasaurus_discovery/sources/quizmeisters/transformer_test.exs`
  - Lines 198-243: Added 5 new test cases for image validation

**Test Cases**:
1. Valid hero image URL passes through
2. Placeholder images are filtered out
3. Thumbnail images are filtered out  
4. Nil hero_image_url handled gracefully
5. Empty string hero_image_url handled gracefully

### 3. Fixed Test Suite

**Files Modified**:
- `test/eventasaurus_discovery/sources/quizmeisters/transformer_test.exs`
  - Updated country expectations from "United States" to "Australia" (correct for Australian service)
  - Updated timezone expectations from "America/New_York" to "Australia/Sydney"
  - Updated currency expectations from "USD" to "AUD"

### 4. Updated Documentation

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/eventasaurus_discovery/sources/quizmeisters/README.md`
  - Line 207: Updated hero image from ❌ to ✅ with validation note

## ✅ Verification Results

### Database Check
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_with_images,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN image_url LIKE '%placeholder%' THEN 1 END) as placeholder_count,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN image_url LIKE '%thumb/%' THEN 1 END) as thumb_count
FROM public_event_sources 
WHERE source_id = 10 AND image_url IS NOT NULL;
```

**Result**:
- ✅ 19 events with valid image URLs
- ✅ 0 placeholder images (correctly filtered)
- ✅ 0 thumbnail images (correctly filtered)

### Test Suite
```bash
mix test test/eventasaurus_discovery/sources/quizmeisters/
```

**Result**:
- ✅ 85 tests total
- ✅ 0 failures
- ✅ 2 excluded (external API tests)
