# Google Places API Alternatives - Comprehensive Analysis

**Date**: 2025-01-12
**Purpose**: Evaluate feasibility of replacing Google Places API with free alternatives

---

## Executive Summary

**Current State**:
- Backend geocoding (scrapers): ‚úÖ Already using OSM ‚Üí Google fallback
- Frontend autocomplete (private events): ‚ùå Still uses Google Places JavaScript
- Monthly cost: ~$10-25 (mostly private event autocomplete)
- Annual cost: ~$120-300

**Recommendation**: Wait and See (Option C) - Only proceed if growth trajectory exceeds 500 events/month or strategic value justifies $2,000-$5,000 development investment.

**ROI at Current Scale**: 36+ years (not economically viable)
**ROI at 2,000 events/month**: 2-5 years (acceptable)

**Backend Conclusion**: Already mostly free via OSM. Total scraper cost: ~$5-10/month.

---

### Frontend Autocomplete (Private Events)

#### Current Implementation
- **File**: `assets/js/hooks/places-search.js` (~580 lines)
- **Method**: Google Places Autocomplete JavaScript widget
- **Features Used**:
  - Real-time autocomplete dropdown (instant suggestions)
  - Rich place data: ratings, price_level, photos, phone, website
  - Location biasing (center + radius)
  - Type filtering (restaurant, entertainment, city, etc.)
  - Address component parsing

#### Current Costs
- **Autocomplete Session**: $0.017 per session
- **Estimated Volume**: 100 private events/month √ó 3 searches = 300 sessions
- **Monthly Cost**: 300 √ó $0.017 = **$5.10**
- **Annual Cost**: **$61.20**
- **5-Year Cost**: **$306.00**

#### What Google Places Provides
‚úÖ **Core Geocoding** (available in free alternatives):
- Place name
- Formatted address
- Coordinates (lat/lng)
- City, state, country
- Basic categories/types

‚ùå **Rich Metadata** (unique to Google Places):
- ‚≠ê Ratings and review counts
- üí∞ Price level indicators
- üì∏ Photos (up to 10 per venue)
- üìû Phone numbers
- üåê Website URLs

#### Where It's Used
- **Private Event Creation**: `lib/eventasaurus_web/live/event_live/new.ex`
  - Lines 1067-1103: venue_selected handler
  - Lines 1129-1163: location_selected handler
  - Stores full Google Places data including place_id, metadata

- **Private Event Editing**: `lib/eventasaurus_web/live/event_live/edit.ex`
  - Lines 1166-1200: location_selected handler
  - Similar integration to new.ex

**Frontend Conclusion**: This is the primary opportunity for cost reduction, but requires significant development.

## Risk Analysis

### High Risk üî¥

**1. Data Quality Degradation**
- **Problem**: OSM data less complete/accurate than Google Places
- **Impact**: Users frustrated with incorrect or missing venues
- **Likelihood**: Medium-High (OSM quality varies by region)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Keep "Enhance with Google Places" button
  - Monitor venue selection error rates
  - Maintain Google Places fallback in code
  - Focus rollout on regions with good OSM coverage (US, Europe first)
  - Add geographic routing (OSM for well-covered regions, Google elsewhere)

**2. Missing Rich Metadata**
- **Problem**: No ratings, photos, phone, website from OSM
- **Impact**: Less informative venue cards, potential user confusion
- **Likelihood**: High (certain - this is a known limitation)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Redesign UI to not emphasize missing data
  - Add "Limited information available" messaging
  - Offer Google Places opt-in for full details
  - Survey users to understand if metadata is actually used
  - Consider scraping/augmenting OSM with public data sources

**3. Geographic Coverage Gaps**
- **Problem**: OSM data sparse in some regions (Asia, Africa, South America)
- **Impact**: Poor experience for users in those regions
- **Likelihood**: High for specific regions
- **Mitigation**:
  - Analyze current user base by geography
  - Rollout to well-covered regions first (US, Canada, Europe)
  - Keep Google Places for low-coverage regions
  - Add geographic routing logic based on user location

---

### Medium Risk üü°

**4. Performance Regression**
- **Problem**: Custom autocomplete slower than Google's widget
- **Impact**: Poor UX, increased load times
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Mitigation**:
  - Performance testing before rollout
  - Use Photon (known for fast responses)
  - Implement local caching
  - Monitor response times in production
  - Set SLA: <500ms p95, rollback if breached

**5. Development Time Overrun**
- **Problem**: Implementation takes longer than estimated
- **Impact**: Delayed rollout, increased dev costs, opportunity cost
- **Likelihood**: Medium-High (new territory, unknowns)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use phased approach with clear milestones
  - Build MVP first (Photon only, basic UI)
  - Defer nice-to-have features to later phases
  - Set hard deadline: if >4 weeks, reassess ROI
  - Time-box each phase strictly

**6. User Resistance to Change**
- **Problem**: Users accustomed to Google Places behavior
- **Impact**: Support requests, negative feedback, adoption resistance
- **Likelihood**: Low-Medium
- **Mitigation**:
  - Gradual rollout (10% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100%)
  - Clear messaging about why change is being made
  - Easy rollback mechanism via feature flag
  - Collect feedback and iterate quickly
  - Provide opt-in for Google Places if needed

---

### Low Risk üü¢

**7. Rate Limiting on Free Tier**
- **Problem**: Free APIs may throttle under heavy load
- **Impact**: Autocomplete becomes slow or fails
- **Likelihood**: Low (with debouncing and caching)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement aggressive debouncing (300ms)
  - Add request caching in sessionStorage
  - Use Mapbox free tier (100K/month) as fallback
  - Monitor request volumes and upgrade if needed
  - Keep Google Places as emergency fallback

**8. Breaking Changes in External APIs**
- **Problem**: Photon/Mapbox change API format or shut down
- **Impact**: Broken autocomplete functionality
- **Likelihood**: Low (established services, active maintenance)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use multiple providers in fallback chain
  - Abstract API integration behind adapter layer
  - Monitor provider status and announcements
  - Keep Google Places as ultimate fallback
  - Contribute to/support open source projects
