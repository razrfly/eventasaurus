# Feature Request: Organizational Roulette - Gamified Group Travel/Event Planning

## üé∞ Executive Summary

Create a gamified group event planning feature where participants contribute to a shared pool for an upcoming vacation/event through monthly subscriptions, with an anonymous organizer managing the details and a roulette-style reveal of the destination.

## üéØ Core Concept

Transform group event planning into an exciting, subscription-based experience where:
- A fixed group of friends commits to an upcoming trip/event
- Everyone contributes monthly to build up the event fund
- One member is secretly designated as the organizer
- The destination/details are revealed in a fun, gamified way
- The anticipation and mystery add excitement to the planning process

## üöÄ Key Features Required

### 1. Group Formation & Locking
- **Closed Group Creation**: Ability to create invite-only groups with a fixed member list
- **Member Commitment**: Members must explicitly opt-in/commit to participation
- **Group Lock Mechanism**: Once locked, no new members can join (only leave with penalties/rules)
- **Minimum/Maximum Participants**: Set constraints (e.g., min 4, max 12 people)

### 2. Anonymous Organizer System
- **Secret Assignment**: Randomly or manually assign one member as the organizer
- **Identity Masking**: Hide organizer identity from other participants
- **Privileged Actions**: Organizer can make decisions without revealing identity
- **Optional Reveal**: Choose when/if to reveal organizer identity (before, during, or after event)

### 3. Subscription & Payment Collection
- **Monthly Subscriptions**: Automated recurring payments from all participants
- **Payment Goals**: Set total fundraising targets with visual progress tracking
- **Milestone Rewards**: Unlock features/reveals as funding milestones are reached
- **Payment Flexibility**:
  - Fixed monthly amounts
  - Variable contributions based on member preferences
  - One-time larger payments option
- **Escrow/Hold System**: Funds held until event confirmation
- **Refund Rules**: Clear policies for cancellations/dropouts

### 4. Gamification Elements
- **Mystery Destination**: Location revealed through clues, puzzles, or countdown
- **Voting Rounds**: 
  - Initial preference polls (beach vs mountain, domestic vs international)
  - Elimination rounds for destination options
  - Activity preference voting
- **Progress Unlocks**:
  - 25% funded: Reveal continent/region
  - 50% funded: Reveal country
  - 75% funded: Reveal city
  - 100% funded: Full itinerary reveal
- **Engagement Mechanics**:
  - Daily/weekly clues about the destination
  - Mini-games or trivia to earn hints
  - Leaderboard for most engaged participants
- **Surprise Elements**: Random bonuses, mystery activities, surprise upgrades

### 5. Enhanced Polling System
- **Anonymous Voting**: Hide who voted for what
- **Weighted Voting**: Give organizer more weight or veto power
- **Preference Ranking**: Rank multiple options instead of single choice
- **Conditional Polls**: "If we go to X, would you prefer Y or Z?"
