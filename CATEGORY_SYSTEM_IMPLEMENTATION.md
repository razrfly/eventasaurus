# Category System Implementation - Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive category normalization system for Eventasaurus that ensures every event always has at least one category, using YAML-based configuration for easy maintenance.

## Implementation Summary

### Phase 1: Fallback System (COMPLETED)
- Added "Other" fallback category to database
- Updated CategoryExtractor to always return at least "Other" if no categories match
- Fixed EventProcessor to always attempt category assignment (no early returns)
- Result: 100% of events now have categories

### Phase 2: YAML Configuration System (COMPLETED)
- Created config/category_mappings directory structure
- Implemented comprehensive YAML mapping files:
  - ticketmaster.yml - Maps Ticketmaster classifications
  - karnet.yml - Maps Polish categories to internal system
  - bandsintown.yml - Maps music/concert categories
  - _defaults.yml - Universal fallback mappings
- Created CategoryMapper module to load and use YAML files
- Updated CategoryExtractor to use YAML mappings instead of database
- Added yaml_elixir dependency for YAML parsing

## Key Components

### 1. YAML Mapping Files
Location: `priv/category_mappings/`

Each file contains:
- Direct mappings (e.g., "koncerty" -> "concerts")
- Pattern-based mappings using regex (e.g., "festival|fest" -> "festivals")
- Support for multiple categories per source category

### 2. CategoryMapper Module
- Loads YAML files at runtime
- Maps source categories to internal category IDs
- Falls back to defaults when source-specific mappings don't exist
- Returns empty array if no match (caller adds "Other" fallback)

### 3. CategoryExtractor Updates
- Now uses CategoryMapper instead of database queries
- Always returns at least "Other" category if no mappings match
- Simplified architecture without database dependency for mappings

### 4. EventProcessor Updates
- Removed early return for empty category data
- Always calls CategoryExtractor even with no categories
- Ensures every event gets at least "Other" category

## How It Works

1. **Raw Data Preservation**: All raw category data from sources is stored in metadata
2. **YAML Mapping**: CategoryMapper loads YAML files and maps source categories
3. **Fallback Logic**: If no categories map, "Other" is assigned
4. **Primary/Secondary**: First mapped category is primary, others are secondary

## Testing Results

- Ticketmaster [Music, Rock] → concerts (primary), nightlife (secondary)
- Karnet [koncerty, jazz] → concerts (primary), arts (secondary)
- Bandsintown [concert, electronic] → concerts (primary), nightlife (secondary)
- Unmapped categories → "Other" category

## Benefits

1. **100% Coverage**: Every event guaranteed to have at least one category
2. **Easy Maintenance**: Add new mappings by editing YAML files (no code changes)
3. **Extensible**: New sources can be added with new YAML files
4. **Performant**: YAML loaded once at startup, fast runtime lookups
5. **Flexible**: Supports pattern matching and multiple category assignment

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Caching**: Add application-level caching for YAML mappings in production
2. **Hot Reload**: Implement YAML reload without restart in development
3. **Admin UI**: Create admin interface to edit YAML mappings
4. **Analytics**: Track unmapped categories to improve mappings over time

## Migration Notes

When reloading data:
1. All existing events will be wiped
2. New events will use YAML mappings
3. Every event will have at least "Other" category
4. Raw category data preserved for future improvements
