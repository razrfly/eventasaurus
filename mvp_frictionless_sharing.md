# ðŸŽ¯ MVP: Frictionless Event Sharing & RSVP System

## Problem Statement

Users face significant friction when organizing events with friends:

1. **Sharing Friction**: Manual copy-paste links, email addresses required
2. **Response Friction**: Facebook's "going vs interested" problem - unclear commitment 
3. **Mobile Gap**: No native iOS/Android apps for quick sharing
4. **Communication Barriers**: Email-only, no SMS/WhatsApp integration
5. **Discovery Issues**: Friends don't see events in their natural communication flows

## Solution Overview

Create a **minimal-friction event sharing system** that maximizes actual attendance through:
- One-click sharing to multiple channels (SMS, WhatsApp, social)
- Three-tier RSVP system (Yes/Maybe/No) avoiding Facebook's "interested" trap
- Mobile-first experience with native app capabilities
- Smart contact integration and suggested invitees
- Rich sharing previews and social proof

## MVP Requirements

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 1: Enhanced Web Sharing (2-3 weeks)

#### 1.1 Multi-Channel Sharing System
**Backend (`lib/eventasaurus_web/live/components/`):**
- [ ] New `SharingModalComponent` with multiple sharing options
- [ ] Add phone number field to `User` schema
- [ ] SMS integration service (Twilio/similar)

**Files to modify:**
- `lib/eventasaurus_app/events/event_participant.ex` - Update status enum

- [ ] Share event updates to attendees

#### 4.2 Polling Integration Enhancement
**Extend existing polling system:**
- [ ] Quick poll creation from invites ("What time works?")
- [ ] Location polling with map integration
- [ ] Activity polling (movie options, restaurant choices)

**Files to modify:**
- `lib/eventasaurus/events/poll.ex` - New poll types
- Existing poll components - Enhanced for sharing context

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Database Changes
```sql
-- Add to users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN phone VARCHAR(20);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN phone_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

-- RSVP tokens
CREATE TABLE rsvp_tokens (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  event_id BIGINT REFERENCES events(id),
  invitee_email VARCHAR(255),
  invitee_phone VARCHAR(20), 
  token VARCHAR(64) UNIQUE,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP,
  used_at TIMESTAMP,
  inserted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enhanced participant status
ALTER TABLE event_participants 
  ALTER COLUMN status TYPE VARCHAR(20),
  ADD CONSTRAINT valid_status CHECK (status IN ('going', 'maybe', 'not_going', 'pending'));
```

### New Services Architecture
```
lib/eventasaurus_web/services/
â”œâ”€â”€ sms_service.ex              # SMS notifications
â”œâ”€â”€ contact_service.ex          # Contact import/matching  
â”œâ”€â”€ sharing_service.ex          # Multi-channel sharing
â”œâ”€â”€ rsvp_service.ex            # Token-based RSVP
â””â”€â”€ notification_service.ex     # Push notifications
```

### API Endpoints
```
POST /api/events/:id/share      # Generate sharing links
POST /api/events/:id/invite     # Send invitations
GET  /rsvp/:token/:status       # One-click RSVP  
POST /api/contacts/import       # Import contacts
GET  /api/contacts/suggestions  # Get friend suggestions
```

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **Invitation Conversion**: % of invites that result in RSVPs
- **Actual Attendance**: % of "going" responses that actually attend
- **Sharing Velocity**: Time from event creation to first invite sent
- **Viral Coefficient**: Avg new users per existing user
- **Mobile Usage**: % of interactions on mobile devices

### Target Goals (3 months post-launch)
- 80%+ invitation response rate (vs current ~40%)
- 90%+ "going" â†’ actual attendance rate
- <30 seconds event creation to first invite
- 1.5+ viral coefficient for active users
- 70%+ mobile usage

## Implementation Priority

### Week 1-2: Foundation
1. Add phone numbers to user accounts
2. SMS service integration
3. Enhanced sharing modal

### Week 3-4: RSVP System
1. Simplified RSVP statuses
2. One-click RSVP tokens
3. Direct response links

### Week 5-6: Smart Suggestions
1. Contact import system
2. Enhanced friend matching
3. Context-aware templates

### Week 7-8: Mobile PWA
1. Service worker setup
2. Native sharing integration
3. Push notifications

### Week 9-12: Native Apps

2. Core sharing features
3. App store deployment

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **SMS costs**: Start with WhatsApp/social sharing, add SMS gradually
- **Contact privacy**: Explicit permissions, GDPR compliance
- **Mobile complexity**: Start with PWA, native apps as phase 2

### Product Risks  
- **Over-engineering**: Ship basic sharing first, iterate based on usage
- **Platform dependencies**: Avoid deep WhatsApp integration initially
- **User adoption**: A/B test invitation templates and flows

## Dependencies

### External Services
- **SMS Provider**: Twilio or similar ($$)
- **Push Notifications**: OneSignal or Firebase ($)
- **Contact APIs**: Platform-specific contact pickers
- **Social APIs**: Open Graph, Twitter Cards

### Internal Dependencies
- Current user authentication system âœ…
- Existing event/participant models âœ…
- LiveView real-time updates âœ…
- Email infrastructure âœ…
